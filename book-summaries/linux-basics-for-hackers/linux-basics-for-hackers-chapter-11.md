# CHAPTER 11: THE LOGGING SYSTEM

---

## The rsyslog Logging Daemon

* Linux uses **rsyslog** (a syslogd variant) to record system and application events.
* Configuration and control files live under `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, `/etc/rsyslog.d/`, and related locations.

### The rsyslog Configuration File

* Found at `/etc/rsyslog.conf`.
* Comprised of **modules**, **global directives**, and **rules**, all in plain-text with extensive comments.

### The rsyslog Logging Rules

* **Syntax**: `facility.priority    action`

  * **facility**: source (e.g., `auth`, `kern`, `mail`, `user`, or `*`).
  * **priority**: severity (`debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warning`, `err`, `crit`, `alert`, `emerg`).
  * **action**: destination (e.g., file under `/var/log/`).
* Examples:

  ```text
  auth,authpriv.*    /var/log/auth.log    # All auth messages
  kern.crit          /var/log/kern.log    # Critical kernel errors
  *.emerg            *                    # Emergencies go to all users
  ```

## Automatically Cleaning Up Logs with logrotate

* **logrotate** archives and optionally compresses old logs, preventing disk fill-up.
* Main config: `/etc/logrotate.conf` (includes `/etc/logrotate.d/`).
* Key directives:

  * `weekly` (time unit)
  * `rotate 4` (keep last 4 periods)
  * `create` (start fresh logs)
  * `compress` (enable compression)
* Adjust `rotate` count for retention length (e.g., `rotate 26` for \~6 months).

## Remaining Stealthy

Hackers must cover trails; defenders must know how logs reveal attacks.

### Removing Evidence

* **shred** securely deletes logs by overwriting data:

  ```bash
  shred -f -n 10 /var/log/auth.log.*  # overwrite 10 times
  ```
* Overwrites wildcards to include rotated logs (`auth.log.1`, etc.).

### Disabling Logging

* Stop the rsyslog daemon (requires root):

  ```bash
  service rsyslog stop    # Halts all new log entries
  ```

## Summary

Log files record vital system events and security information. You saw how to configure rsyslog rules, automate log rotation with logrotate, and, from an attackerâ€™s perspective, how to shred or disable logs to erase footprints.

## Exercises

1. Use `locate rsyslog` to list all rsyslog-related files.
2. Edit `/etc/logrotate.conf` to rotate logs weekly.
3. Disable logging (`service rsyslog stop`) and observe entries in `/var/log/syslog`.
4. Shred all `kern.log` files using `shred`.
