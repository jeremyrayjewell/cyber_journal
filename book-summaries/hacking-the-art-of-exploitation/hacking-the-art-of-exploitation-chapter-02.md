# CHAPTER 0x200: PROGRAMMING

---

## 0x210 What is Programming?

* **Dual nature of hacking**: writing elegant code and exploiting it share problem‑solving techniques.
* **Programming hacks** focus on inventive rules‑based solutions for efficiency and elegance—small, neat, inventive code.
* **Exploit hacks** use system rules to bypass security in unintended ways.
* **Business vs. hacker mindset**: commercial code prioritizes features over optimization; hackers relish optimization on constrained platforms (e.g., Commodore 64) and necessity of minimal exploits.

---

## 0x220 Pseudo-code

* **Definition**: informal, English‑like instructions structured like code; not machine‑readable, but clarifies algorithm logic.
* **Syntax flexibility**: varies by author; typically C‑style braces and semicolons for readability.

## 0x230 Control Structures

Without control structures, code is linear. Control structures alter flow based on conditions.

### 0x231 If‑Then‑Else

<pre markdown>
if (condition) {
    // execute when true
} else {
    // execute when false
}
</pre>

* Handles conditional branching (e.g., alternate driving routes when road blocked).
* Braces optional for single‑statement blocks, but recommended for clarity.

### 0x232 While/Until Loops

* **while**: repeat a block *while* a condition remains true.

<pre markdown>
while (hungry) {
find\_food();
eat\_food();
}
</pre>
- **until** (Perl syntax): repeat _until_ a condition becomes true—equivalent to `while (!condition)`.

### 0x233 For Loops  
- Iteration counter loops for fixed repetitions.  
<pre markdown>
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    drive_one_mile();
}
</pre>

* Equivalent to initializing a counter and using a `while` loop with increment.
