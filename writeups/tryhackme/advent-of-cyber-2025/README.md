# Advent of Cyber 2025 – Writeups
This directory contains my personal writeups for TryHackMe’s Advent of Cyber 2025 event. Each file documents the technical steps I completed for the corresponding daily challenge, following a consistent structure: date, challenge category, skills practiced, a concise summary, a walkthrough of relevant commands or analysis steps, and key takeaways. These documents are intended for personal study and reference.

I avoid including any challenge flags in the writeups to keep them spoiler-free. Where applicable, I note environmental errors or platform issues that prevented certain tasks from being fully completed.

Each writeup is named using the following format: `DayXX.md`


## Purpose
These writeups exist to:

- Reinforce the concepts behind each challenge  
- Track technical progress throughout the event  
- Maintain a consistent body of study material  
- Build a record suitable for review, teaching, and portfolio reference  
- Provide a disciplined approach to incident analysis, enumeration, and reverse engineering workflows

This repository does not include flags, answers, or any solution material that would undermine the design of the challenges.
