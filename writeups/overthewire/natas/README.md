# Natas CTF Write-ups

This directory contains write-ups, tools, and experiment logs for the **Natas** wargame from OverTheWire. Natas is a web application security challenge that teaches practical offensive and defensive skills through increasingly complex vulnerabilities.

## Overview

Each level in Natas exposes a specific type of web vulnerability. The goal is to analyze the server’s behavior and/or source code, understand the flaw, and retrieve the password for the next level.

These write-ups are focused on:

- Identifying the vulnerability
- Understanding its technical impact
- Reproducing exploitation in both browser and command-line environments
- Practicing bash, curl, and encoding/decoding tools
- Documenting the reasoning process in a consistent format

## Format

Each write-up includes:

- Date completed
- Obfuscated password (ROT13)
- Objective summary
- Purpose of the challenge
- Solution with technical breakdown

## Authorship

All write-ups and tools were created by **Jeremy Ray Jewell** as part of an ongoing effort to build hands-on web security expertise.
