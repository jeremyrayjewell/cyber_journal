## OBJECTIVE

> "There is nothing on this page."

## PURPOSE ##

This level teaches that an “empty” page can still leak data via supporting assets and misconfigured directory listings. The crucial idea is to pivot from the rendered page to the assets it references and then try **directory enumeration**.

### Why initial source inspection doesn’t show `users.txt`
- The HTML of the landing page only references an image asset at `/files/pixel.png`. The list of files inside `/files/` is **not part of this HTML**; it is generated by the web server **only when you browse directly to the `/files/` directory URL** (an auto-index view when no `index.html` exists).  
- Because of that, “View Source” on the landing page can’t reveal `users.txt`. It never references it.

### How to infer the `/files/` directory method (even if “Sources” seems unhelpful)
- **Follow asset paths** seen in HTML or the **Network** panel (e.g., `/files/pixel.png`). Then try removing the filename to visit the parent directory: `/files/`.  
- **Heuristic enumeration**: try common folders like `/files/`, `/img/`, `/images/`, `/uploads/`, `/css/`, `/js/`, `/static/`, `/assets/`.  
- **Check `robots.txt`/`sitemap.xml`** for hints to hidden paths.  
- **Observe server behavior**: if `/files/` returns HTTP 200 with a listing, auto-indexing is enabled; if 403, listing is blocked; if 404, path doesn’t exist.  
- **CLI-first mindset**: use `curl` to test directories quickly; later challenges may justify wordlists with tools like `gobuster`/`ffuf`, but here simple inference from `/files/pixel.png` is enough.

## SOLUTIONS ##

### Method 1: Manual Browsing
- Authenticate as **natas2** and open the level:  
  URL: `http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org`  
  Username: `natas2`
- Use **View Source** (Ctrl+U / ⌘+Option+U). You’ll see an `<img>` pointing to `/files/pixel.png`.
- Remove the filename and browse directly to the directory:  
  `http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/`
- Directory listing is enabled. Open `users.txt` and find the next credential. Use the plaintext privately; this write-up records only the ROT13 above.

### Method 2: curl / wget (no browser)
- List the directory:
    
    curl -u natas2:<password-for-natas2> http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/
- Retrieve the credentials file:
    
    curl -u natas2:<password-for-natas2> http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/users.txt
- The line for `natas3` contains the password; store it securely and record its ROT13 in the header.
