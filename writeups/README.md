# CTF & Wargames Writeups

Markdown write-ups stored here.
File pattern: "name-XX" where
- `name` = game name
- `XX` = level (00-99)

## Passwords (ROT13)

No spoilers! Passwords are ROT13-obfuscated here
and often updated by game admins anyways
To decode the ones I found:

```bash
echo -n "obfuscated_password" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
