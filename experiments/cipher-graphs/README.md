# cipher-graphs

**cipher-graphs** is a collection of Python-based visualizations that bring cryptographic algorithms to life. Whether you're exploring RSA, DSA, or elliptic curves like Curve25519, this project helps you see the math behind the security â€” literally.

## Purpose
Cryptography is often taught with equations and theory. This project flips the script by using **graphics, animations, and 3D plots** to make asymmetric encryption and digital signatures **visually intuitive** and **educational**.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- matplotlib
- numpy
- sympy
- pycryptodome
- Optional: mayavi or plotly (for advanced 3D visualizations)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy sympy pycryptodome plotly mayavi
```
