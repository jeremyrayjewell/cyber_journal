# CHAPTER 0x700: CRYPTOLOGY

---

## 0x710. Information Theory

* **Information vs. uncertainty**: information measures the reduction in uncertainty; *entropy* (in bits) quantifies average uncertainty per symbol.
* **Entropy intuitions**: uniform distributions maximize entropy; biased distributions compress better (predictable symbols carry less information).
* **Perfect secrecy goal**: a ciphertext that statistically reveals **no** information about its plaintext without the key (foreshadows 0x711–0x712).

---

## 0x711. Unconditional Security

* **Definition**: security that holds **even with unlimited computation**; breaking it would require violating information-theoretic limits, not just “hard math.”
* **Implication**: schemes with unconditional security resist all present/future computers (including quantum), but are rare and typically impractical to deploy at scale.

---

## 0x712. OneTime Pads

* **Construction**: `C = P ⊕ K` with a key `K` that is truly random, **as long as `P`**, used **once**, and kept secret → yields **perfect secrecy**.
* **Non-negotiables**: reusing a pad (key) across messages leaks `P1 ⊕ P2`; poor randomness or pad distribution breaks guarantees.
* **Operational pain**: secure generation, storage, and delivery of pad material at message length is the real challenge.

---

## 0x713. Quantum Key Distribution

* **Core idea**: use quantum states (e.g., polarized photons) so **measurement disturbs** the state; eavesdropping raises error rates discoverable by the endpoints.
* **Role**: QKD **distributes keys**; it doesn’t itself encrypt data. You still pair it with symmetric ciphers once a key is shared.

---

## 0x714. Computational Security

* **Pragmatic model**: assume some problems are **infeasible** to solve within available time/resources (e.g., factoring large integers, discrete logarithms).
* **Security knob**: choose parameters (key sizes, curves, moduli) so the **work factor** of the best known attack exceeds realistic budgets by wide margins.

---

## 0x720. Algorithmic Run Time

* **Work factor matters**: the gap between practical security and compromise is an **algorithmic** one (time/space).
* **Scaling**: exponential vs. polynomial time dictates which key sizes remain safe as hardware improves.

---

## 0x721. Asymptotic Notation

* **Big-O / Ω / Θ**: describe **growth rates**, not exact runtimes; used to compare attack cost vs. parameter size.
* **Takeaway**: even small algorithmic improvements (e.g., square-root speedups) can force **doubling** of key sizes.

---

## 0x730. Symmetric Encryption

* **Two main families**:
  * **Block ciphers** (AES): encrypt fixed-size blocks with modes (CBC, CTR, GCM). Modes define **error propagation**, **parallelizability**, and **nonce/IV** requirements.
  * **Stream ciphers** (RC4, Salsa/ChaCha): generate a keystream `K` and XOR with plaintext; **never reuse** a keystream with different messages.
* **Keys & nonces**: IV/nonce misuse (repeats) is a common root cause of practical breaks.

---

## 0x731. Lov Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm

* **Square-root speedup**: reduces brute-force search over `N` keys from `O(N)` to **`O(√N)`**.
* **Key-size consequence**: to preserve security margin against Grover, **double** symmetric key sizes (e.g., AES-128 → ~AES-256).

---

## 0x740. Asymmetric Encryption

* **Public/private keys**: one key encrypts, the other decrypts; built on **one-way trapdoor** functions (easy forward, hard inverse without trapdoor).
* **Uses**: key exchange, digital signatures, and bootstrapping symmetric sessions.

---

## 0x741. RSA

* **Setup**: choose primes `p,q`; `n=pq`; `φ(n)=(p−1)(q−1)`; pick `e` coprime to `φ(n)`; compute `d ≡ e⁻¹ (mod φ(n))`.
* **Operations**: `C ≡ M^e mod n`; `M ≡ C^d mod n`. Security rests on the **difficulty of factoring `n`**.
* **Practice**: use padding (OAEP/PSS), strong randomness, and safe prime sizes; protect `d`/CRT parameters against side-channels.

---

## 0x742. Peter Shor's Quantum Factoring Algorithm

* **Impact**: factors integers (and computes discrete logs) in **polynomial time** on a fault-tolerant quantum computer → breaks RSA/DH/DSA/ECDSA in principle.
* **Mitigation path**: migrate to **post-quantum** primitives (lattice/code/hash-based) once standardized and available.

---

## 0x750. Hybrid Ciphers

* **Why hybrid**: asymmetric crypto is slow; symmetric is fast. Encrypt the **bulk data** with a symmetric key, and use asymmetric crypto only to **protect the key**.
* **Modern pattern**: authenticated key exchange → derive traffic keys → AEAD (e.g., AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305) for data.

---

## 0x751. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks

* **Threat**: attacker interposes between endpoints, relaying and possibly altering messages; succeeds when **authenticity** of keys is not verified.
* **Defenses**: strong **authentication** (certificates, signed key exchanges), channel binding, user-visible trust anchors.

---

## 0x752. Differing SSH Protocol Host Fingerprints

* **Problem**: a host key change (new install, reimage) triggers a **mismatch** alert; users often click through warnings.
* **Risk**: accepting an unexpected fingerprint can **bless an attacker’s key**, inviting MITM; proper procedure is **out-of-band verification**.

---

## 0x753. Fuzzy Fingerprints

* **Idea**: encode key fingerprints in formats users can reliably compare (visual hashes, word lists) to reduce human error.
* **Trade-off**: must balance memorability with low collision/ambiguity risk; still requires **user discipline** to verify.

---

## 0x760. Password Cracking

* **Model**: offline attacker gets hashed passwords → attempts guesses until a match; cost depends on **hash function** and **guess distribution**.

---

## 0x761. Dictionary Attacks

* **Approach**: try likely words/phrases with mangling rules; leverages real-world password choices (names, dates, substitutions).

---

## 0x762. Exhaustive BruteForce Attacks

* **Approach**: try **all** strings over a character set up to some length; time scales as `|Σ|^L` (or `√` of that under Grover for symmetric keys).

---

## 0x763. Hash Lookup Table

* **Concept**: precompute `(password → hash)` mappings to invert hashes quickly; rainbow tables compress storage by clever **chain reductions**.
* **Defenses**: **salt** per password, slow/KDF hashes (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2), and rate limiting.

---

## 0x764. Password Probability Matrix

* **Generative models**: use Markov chains or n-gram stats to rank guesses by **likelihood**, prioritizing high-probability candidates.
* **Benefit**: cracks more passwords earlier than naive dictionary or uniform brute force.

---

## 0x770. Wireless 802.11b Encryption

* **Context**: early Wi-Fi security relied on **WEP** over 802.11b with **RC4**; protocol/implementation quirks undermined its goals.

---

## 0x771. Wired Equivalent Privacy

* **Design**: RC4 with a **per-packet IV** concatenated to a shared key; appends an integrity checksum (CRC-32).
* **Flaws**: small IV space (24-bit) leads to repeats; CRC is linear (not cryptographic MAC); key mixing leaks structure.

---

## 0x772. RC4 Stream Cipher

* **Mechanics**: key scheduling algorithm (KSA) → pseudo-random generation (PRGA) → XOR keystream with plaintext.
* **Cautions**: early-keystream biases; **never reuse** keystreams; poor KSA/IV handling → exploitable correlations.

---

## 0x780. WEP Attacks

* **Theme**: exploit **IV reuse**, **RC4 biases**, and **linear CRC** to recover keystreams/keys and inject traffic.

---

## 0x781. Offline BruteForce Attacks

* **Capture-then-crack**: sniff enough traffic; use known plaintext segments to derive keystream and accelerate key search offline.

---

## 0x782. Keystream Reuse

* **XOR oracle**: two packets encrypted with same keystream satisfy `C1 ⊕ C2 = P1 ⊕ P2`; any known plaintext reveals the other’s plaintext.

---

## 0x783. IV-Based Decryption Dictionary Tables

* **Dictionary building**: collect ciphertexts keyed by IV values; when IVs repeat, lookups recover plaintext/keystream without recomputation.

---

## 0x784. IP Redirection

* **Pivot**: craft/inject packets to redirect traffic through attacker-controlled hosts, increasing opportunities to collect IVs and known plaintexts.

---

## 0x785. Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir Attack

* **FMS insight**: specific **weak IVs** bias RC4’s first output bytes; with many packets, statistical analysis recovers key bytes.
* **Outcome**: practical, fast WEP key recovery → motivated the industry’s shift away from WEP to WPA/WPA2.
