## Overview  

Section 2 focuses on enabling **hands-on practice** with Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online in a safe, controlled way. Rather than assuming access to a production tenant, this section explains how to use **simulations** and **trial subscriptions** to build practical experience without risk. It also clarifies common points of confusion around assignments, licensing, portals, and regional limitations.

The emphasis is on removing friction: understanding what is *required* versus *optional*, how to avoid breaking real environments, and how to continue learning even when full lab access is unavailable.

## Module 2.1: IMPORTANT – Using Assignments in the Course  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand how assignments and simulations function in the course  
- Know how assignments affect course completion  

**Key Topics:**  
- Assignments consist of externally hosted, hands-on simulations  
- Simulations should be opened in a new tab to return to Udemy afterward  
- Simulations guide users through administrative steps for practice  
- Assignment checkboxes may not update reliably due to Udemy issues  
- Assignment completion is **not required** for course completion or certificate eligibility  
- Only video completion determines certificate issuance

## Module 2.2: DO NOT SKIP – Before Beginning Your Account Setup  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand the requirements for setting up a Microsoft 365 lab environment  
- Identify limitations and alternatives for trial availability by region  

**Key Topics:**  
- Course labs require a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription  
- Free access is obtained by starting an Office 365 E5 trial, then activating Microsoft 365 E5  
- Trial availability varies by country and may not be supported in all regions  
- Instructor cannot resolve regional or eligibility limitations  
- Alternatives if free trial is unavailable:
	- Microsoft 365 Developer Program (where supported)  
	- Paid 30-day Microsoft 365 E5 trial (one license only)  
- Microsoft Teams is not enabled by default but can be activated separately as a 30-day trial  
- Lab setup is required to fully follow along with hands-on portions of the course

## Module 2.3: Creating a Trial Microsoft 365 / Azure Account  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand how to create a safe Microsoft 365 lab environment for hands-on practice  
- Learn how to activate, assign, and later cancel a Microsoft 365 trial subscription  
- Recognize regional limitations and alternative options for lab access  

**Key Topics:**  
- Creating a separate lab account prevents risk to production or business environments  
- A free email account (e.g., Outlook, Gmail) is required for signup  
- Trial signup is accessed via examlabpractice.com/microsoft365 to avoid broken links  
- Phone number verification is required during account creation  
- Office 365 E5 trial is used to activate Microsoft 365 E5 features  
- Admin portal access has shifted from portal.microsoft.com to admin.microsoft.com  
- Microsoft 365 E5 must be activated separately via Marketplace and assigned to the admin user  
- Subscription availability varies by country; E3 or Business Premium may be viable alternatives  
- Trials must be manually canceled after 30 days to avoid charges  
- Microsoft 365 Developer Program may be available in some regions as an alternative  
- Even without a lab account, learners can still progress using course videos and simulations

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Hands-on simulations are a core learning tool, but they are **optional** and not required for course completion  
- Assignment checkboxes in Udemy are unreliable and have **no impact** on certificates  
- Only video completion determines course completion and certification  
- A dedicated Microsoft 365 lab account is strongly recommended to avoid impacting real environments  
- Microsoft 365 E5 features are accessed via an Office 365 E5 trial, then activated separately  
- Trial availability and licensing options vary by country and are outside the instructor’s control  
- Microsoft 365 admin portals and naming conventions change frequently; adaptability is required  
- Paid trials or alternative subscriptions (E3, Business Premium) may still support most course activities  
- Even without a lab tenant, learners can still gain value through videos and guided simulations  
- Understanding licensing, activation, and cancellation is a foundational administrative skill
