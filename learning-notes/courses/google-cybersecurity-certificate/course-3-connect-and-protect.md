- Configuring and using firewalls, VPNs, and proxy servers  
- Detecting and mitigating intrusion tactics (DoS/DDoS, sniffing, spoofing)  
- Implementing OS, network, and cloud hardening techniques  
- Using SIEM tools for log analysis and network monitoring  

---

## **Common Network Attacks Covered**  
**Denial-of-Service Attacks:** SYN flood, ICMP flood, Ping of Death  
**Packet Sniffing:** Passive (reading packets), Active (altering packets)  
**IP Spoofing Attacks:** On-path, replay, Smurf attacks  
**Mitigations:** Encryption, HTTPS, VPN usage, firewall rules, avoiding unsecured networks  

---

## **Security Hardening Practices**  
- **General:** Reduce attack surface, apply updates, disable unused ports/services, strong password policies, penetration testing  
- **OS Hardening:** Baseline configurations, MFA, secure software/hardware disposal  
- **Network Hardening:** Firewall rule maintenance, network segmentation, SIEM log review, encryption standards  
- **Cloud Hardening:** Baseline server images, segregating data by function, shared responsibility with provider  

---
