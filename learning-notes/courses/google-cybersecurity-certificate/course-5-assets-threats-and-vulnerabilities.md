# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities – Notes  

## Google Cybersecurity Certificate (Course 5 of 9) 

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/assets-threats-and-vulnerabilities/home/welcome)

---

### **Course Overview**
Course 5 focuses on identifying and classifying assets, recognizing different types of threats, and assessing vulnerabilities. Learners explore **risk assessment methodologies**, how to manage asset inventories, and how to prioritize security measures based on threat likelihood and impact.

---

### **Core Structure**
1. Introduction to Asset Security
2. Protected Organizational Assets
3. Vulnerabilities in Systems
4. Threats to Asset Security

## **Key Cybersecurity Concepts & Acronyms**
- **Asset** – Any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities.
- **Threat** – Anything capable of acting against an asset in a way that can result in harm.
- **Vulnerability** – Weakness or gap in protection efforts.
- **Risk** – Likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability.
- **CIA Triad** – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
- **CVE** – Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.
- **CVSS** – Common Vulnerability Scoring System.
- **OSINT** – Open-Source Intelligence.
- **IDS/IPS** – Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems.
- **SIEM** – Security Information and Event Management.
- **MFA** – Multi-Factor Authentication.

---

## **Core Skills Introduced**
- Conduct and maintain asset inventories.
- Identify and prioritize assets by criticality.
- Recognize and categorize threats.
- Identify and document vulnerabilities.
- Perform basic risk assessments combining asset value, threats, and vulnerabilities.
- Recommend controls based on risk levels.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Asset Inventory** – Complete, up-to-date list of hardware, software, data, and personnel relevant to the organization.
- **Critical Assets** – Assets essential to business operations, requiring priority in protection.
- **Threat** – Any circumstance or event with potential to adversely impact organizational operations, assets, or individuals.
- **Vulnerability** – Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited.
- **Risk** – The intersection of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities; likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and causing harm.

---

## Asset Management Best Practices
- Maintain **automated asset discovery** tools for real-time updates.
- Use **classification schemes** (e.g., public, internal, confidential, restricted).
- Apply **configuration management** to enforce secure, standardized setups.

---

## Threat Intelligence
- Use **threat feeds** and **OSINT** (Open-Source Intelligence) to track emerging risks.
- Correlate intelligence with known vulnerabilities via **CVE** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) databases.

---

## Vulnerability Management
- Conduct **regular vulnerability scans** with authenticated and unauthenticated methods.
- Track vulnerabilities with **CVSS** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores for prioritization.
- Implement **patch management** cycles and test patches before deployment.

---

## Acronyms from the Readings
- **CVE** – Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
- **CVSS** – Common Vulnerability Scoring System
- **OSINT** – Open-Source Intelligence
- **IDS** – Intrusion Detection System
- **IPS** – Intrusion Prevention System
- **SIEM** – Security Information and Event Management
- **MFA** – Multi-Factor Authentication

---

## Analyst Responsibilities Highlighted
- Identify and prioritize assets for protection.
- Correlate asset importance with vulnerabilities and threat data.
- Recommend risk treatment options (mitigation, transfer, acceptance, avoidance).

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- Asset, threat, and vulnerability data must be continuously updated to reflect real-world conditions.
- Analysts must use both automated tools and human analysis to maintain security posture.
- Risk management decisions should balance cost, operational needs, and threat landscape changes.
