## Course 2 – Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks  

---

## Overview  
Course 2 focuses on identifying, assessing, and managing security risks through the application of frameworks, controls, and industry-standard tools. It introduces learners to the CISSP security domains, NIST’s Risk Management Framework, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools, and incident response playbooks. The course emphasizes the real-world application of these concepts in protecting business operations.

## Module 1: Security Domains  
This module examines the CISSP’s eight security domains and their role in protecting business operations. Learners identify primary threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, and explore how entry-level security analysts address them. NIST’s Risk Management Framework (RMF) is also introduced as a structured approach to mitigating risks.  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize and explain the CISSP’s eight security domains  
- Identify and define threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to business operations  
- Understand which threats are most relevant to entry-level analysts  
- Assess how these factors impact business operations  
- Identify the steps in risk management  

**Key Topics:**  
- Overview of CISSP security domains  
- Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities in cybersecurity  
- Impact on business continuity  
- Introduction to NIST RMF

## Module 2: Security Frameworks and Controls  
This module explores the purpose and structure of security frameworks and controls, and how they interconnect to protect organizations. Learners study the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), OWASP principles, and internal security audits.  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define and describe security frameworks and controls  
- Apply the CIA triad in organizational contexts  
- Understand and use NIST frameworks  
- Identify OWASP security principles  
- Plan and conduct internal security audits  

**Key Topics:**  
- Relationship between frameworks and controls  
- CIA triad in practice  
- NIST CSF functions and applications  
- OWASP security principles  
- Internal audit process and best practices  

**Portfolio Activity:**  
- **Conduct a Security Audit**: Learners complete an audit activity to simulate internal assessment procedures.

## Module 3: Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools  
This module focuses on Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools and their application in monitoring and protecting business operations. Learners explore SIEM dashboards, log analysis, and the daily workflows of security analysts using these tools.  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify and define SIEM tools  
- Describe their use in protecting business operations  
- Explain how analysts use SIEM dashboards to detect threats  

**Key Topics:**  
- Logs and SIEM fundamentals  
- Dashboard navigation and use cases  
- Scenario-based SIEM analysis for threat identification

## Module 4: Use Playbooks to Respond to Incidents  
This module details the role of incident response playbooks in cybersecurity operations. Learners explore the phases of an incident response plan and how to use playbooks in conjunction with SIEM and SOAR tools to address threats.  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define the purpose of an incident response playbook  
- Use playbooks to respond to threats, risks, or vulnerabilities  
- Integrate playbooks with SIEM and SOAR tools  

**Key Topics:**  
- Phases of an incident response playbook  
- Practical response exercises  
- Diversity of perspective in security team decision-making
