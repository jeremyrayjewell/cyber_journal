## Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Cybersecurity Foundations (Course 2 of 9) 

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks/home/welcome)

---

### **Course Overview**  
Course 2 builds on foundational security concepts by introducing **risk management** as the central process in cybersecurity. Learners explore how to **identify**, **assess**, and **prioritize** risks, as well as how to apply **security controls** to reduce them. The course covers frameworks such as **NIST RMF** and **CSF**, the security policies that guide organizational behavior, and the compliance obligations tied to various industries.

## Core Structure  
1. Security Domains  
2. Security Frameworks and Controls  
3. Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools 
4. Use Playbooks to Respond to Incidents

## Key Cybersecurity Concepts & Acronyms  
- **CISSP Security Domains** – 8 areas: Security & Risk Management, Asset Security, Security Architecture & Engineering, Communication & Network Security, IAM, Security Assessment & Testing, Security Operations, Software Development Security  
- **CIA Triad** – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability: foundational model for securing data  
- **NIST RMF** – Risk Management Framework; systematic process for handling risks  
- **CTF** – Cyber Threat Framework: categorizes and tracks threat activities  
- **SIEM** – Security Information and Event Management; collects/analyzes logs for suspicious activity  
- **SOAR** – Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response; automates incident handling workflows  
- **OWASP Top 10** – Industry-standard list of critical web application risks  
- **IOC** – Indicator of Compromise; evidence of potential breach  
- **MFA** – Multi-Factor Authentication; layered login security  
- **PII** – Personally Identifiable Information  
- **APT** – Advanced Persistent Threat

---

## Common Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities Covered  
**Threat Types:**  
- Insider threats (malicious or accidental)  
- APTs (long-term, targeted campaigns)  
- Hacktivists (politically motivated)  

**Vulnerabilities & Risks:**  
- Legacy systems  
- Misconfigured assets  
- Unpatched zero-day exploits (Log4Shell, ZeroLogon)  

**Attack Examples:**  
- Phishing (BEC, spear phishing, whaling)  
- Credential attacks (brute force, password spraying)  
- Supply chain compromises  
- IoT device exploitation  

---

## Security Frameworks & Controls  
**Frameworks:** NIST RMF, CTF, ISO/IEC 27001, CIS Controls  
**Control Types:**  
- **Physical** – Locks, CCTV  
- **Technical** – Firewalls, encryption, MFA  
- **Administrative** – Policy enforcement, separation of duties  

---

## Ethics in Cybersecurity  
- Adhere to laws like CFAA; no unauthorized counterattacks  
- Ensure proportional, reversible, and targeted actions if responding (per international rules)  
- Maintain transparency, privacy, and unbiased decision-making  

---

## Portfolio Development in Course 2  
- **Incident Response Playbook Outline** – Created as an applied example  
- **SIEM Walkthrough Notes** – Recorded observations on dashboard functions  
- **Framework Mapping Exercise** – Linked CISSP domains to real-world controls  

---

## Key Takeaways from Course 2  
- Understand the **CISSP 8 domains** and how they structure security work  
- Apply **risk management strategies**: accept, avoid, transfer, mitigate  
- Recognize the role of **frameworks and controls** in maintaining security posture  
- Learn how **SIEM** and **SOAR** tools aid in detection, analysis, and response  
- Begin integrating playbooks into portfolio to show procedural knowledge
