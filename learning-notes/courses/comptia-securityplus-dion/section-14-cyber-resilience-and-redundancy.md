- **Sag:** a small and unexpected decrease in the amount of voltage that is being provided
	- it is common to see sags that drop the voltage from 120 volts to 117 or 115 volts instead
- **Undervoltage Event:** occurs when the coltage is reduced to lower levels and usually occur for a longer period of time
- **Power Loss Event:** occurs when there is a total loss of power for a given period of time
	- with a complete power loss event, it is important to be aware that when power is restored it can also cause a power spike
- **Line Conditioners:** used to overcome any minor fluctuations in the power being recceived by the given system
	- automatically adjust the power signal being received as an undervoltage or overvoltage condition and change it back to the standard power level
- **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS):** a device that provides emergency power to a system when the normal input power source has failed
- **Generator:** machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy for use in an external circuit through the process of electromagnatic induction
	- portable gas-engine, permanently installed, battery-inverter
- **Power Distribution Center (PDC):** acts as a central hub where power is received and then distributed to all systems in the data center
	- most large data centers will use a rack mounted uninterrupted power supply to provide line conditioning and battery backup
	- the data center should use power distribution units for line conditioning and load balancing from the main utility power source to each server rack

		- it's important to remember that the backed up data might be vulnerable to destruction
	- **Offsite Backup:** the practice of storing duplicate copies of data at a geographically separate location from the primary data source to provide protection against physical disasters and to ensure data continuity
	- **Frequency:** how much data is the company willing to lose?
		- consider the RPO of the organization to confirm that the backup plan preserves the necessary data mount
		- another consideration is how frequently the data will be changed inside of the business
- **Encryption on Backups:** fundamental safeguard that protects the backup data from unauthorized access and potential breaches
	- Data-at-rest Encryption, Data-in-transit Encryption

- **Warm site:** partially equipped, moderate recovery and cost  
- **Cold site:** basic space, slowest recovery, lowest cost  
- **Redundant Site:** alternative sites for backup in case the primary location encounters a failure or interruption
	- **Hot Site:** a fully equipped backup facility ready to swiftly take over in case of a primary site failure or disruption
		- cloud computing makes hot sites more accessible, however, it does not encompass all of its needs
		- a cloud hot site offers fast data recovery but is better suited for mission-critical functions
	- **Warm Site:** a partially equipped backup site that can become operational within days of a primary site disruption
		- warm sites may provide essentials like power, phone lines, and network connectivity
		- in a hybrid model, critical employees go to a hit site, while the rest relocate to a warm or cold site as part of the DRP
	- **Cold Site:** a site with no immediate equipment or infrastructure but can be transformed into a functional backup facility
- **Mobile Site:** a versatile site that utilizes independent and portable unites like trailers or tents to deliver recovery capabilities
	- the key benefit of a mobile recovery site is its self-sufficiency
	- choosing the appropriate site/sites is a decision for senior managers, considering various business needs and scenarios
	- a full hot site may be use for servers and not for employees
	- microwave link, local cable connection, cellular modem
	- in addition to the four main types of redundant sites, there is a fifth type that has been added recently
- **Virtual Site:** utilizes cloud-based environments and offers highly flexible approach to redundancy
	- **Virtual Hot Site:** fully replicated and instantly accessible
	- **Virtual Warm Site:** prtially replicated and scalable
	- **Virtual Cold Site:** minimal activation to minimize costs
	- *scalability, cost-effectiveness, easy maintenance*
- **Platform Diversity:** a vital aspect in redundant site design that uses different platforms to prevent single points of failure in disaster recovery
	- **Cloud-Provider Platform Diversity:** entails spreading resources across multiple cloud providers or regions, reducing the risk of a single platform outage
	- platform diversity also includes using different systems and infrastructure
- weigh the risks and rewards to determine the best approach for the organization
- when selecting the backup site, consider both the tech stack and the employee workspace support
- continuity of operations is critical to maintaining essential functions and services during disruptions
