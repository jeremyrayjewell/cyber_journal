	- OPSEC involves staying discreet about work schedule and business deals during casual conversations
	- removable devices, cables
	- baiting tactics may be used such as dropping a thumb drive so that someone may take and connect it to a workstation

	- cables such as charging cables in public areas may also be used as bait to attempt to infect a device
- social engineers may also manipulate individuals into trusting them by using cons
- pressure tactics are likely to succeed because people often make mistakes when rushed to take an action
- proactive measures are crucial to evade traps set by social engineers
- foster a culture of security with regular cybersecurity training
- educate all emplpoyees on recognizing phishing attempts and valuing data privacy
- encourage employees to report suspicious activities
- conduct practical exercises like simulated phishing attacks
