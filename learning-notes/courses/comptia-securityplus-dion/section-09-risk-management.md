- Sources: internal processes, external threats, supply chain, compliance gaps  
- Documentation of risks feeds into a risk register 
- **Risk Identification:** proactively recognizing potential risks tht could negatively impact an organization's ability to operate or achieve its objectives
	- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** represents the maximum acceptable length of time that can elapse before the ack of a business function severely impacts the oganiation
	- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time
		- if an organization has an RPO of four hours, it means the business can tolerate a data loss of up to four hours
	- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):** representes the average time required to repair a failed component or system
	- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):** represents the average time between failures
		- 5 times in a year means that it has a MTBF of 2.4 months or roughly 72 days
- *techniques:* brainstorming, checklists, interviews, scenario analysis
- the organization should consider a wide range of risks, including operational, financial, strategic, and reputational risks
- after identifying potential risks, document and analyze them based on their possible impact and probability
- **Business Impact Analysis:** process that involves evaluating the potential effects of disruption to an organization's business functions and processes

## Module 9.4: Risk Register  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define risk registers and their use  
- Explain what information they track  

**Key Topics:**  
- Repository of identified risks  
- Contains risk descriptions, likelihood, impact, owners, mitigation strategies  
- Provides a centralized tool for decision-making 
- Risk Management is crucial for projects and businesses, involving the identification and assessment of uncertainties that may impact objectives
- **Risk Register:** a key tool in risk management, featuring key risk indicators, risk owners, and risk thresholds
- **Risk Register (Risk Log):** a document detailing identified risks, including their description, impact likelihood, and mitigation strategies
	- a Risk Register may resemble the heat map risk matric
- key areas of the *Risk Register*:
	- **Risk description:** entails identifying and providing a detailed description of the risk
	- **Risk impact:** potential consequences if the risk materializes
	- **Risk likelihood/probability:** chance of a particular risk occurring
	- **Risk outcome:** result of a risk, linked to its impact and likelihood
	- **Risk level/threshold:** determined by combining the impact and the likelihood
	- **Cost:** pertains to its financial impact on the project, including potential expenses if it occurs or the cost of risk mitigation
- **Risk Tolerance/Acceptance:** refers to an organization or individual's willingness to deal with uncertainty in pursuit of their goals
- **Risk Appetite:** signifies an organization's willingness to embrace or retain specific types and levels of risk to fulfill its strategic goals
	- **Expansionary Risk Appetite:** organization is open to taking more risk in the hopes of achieving greater returns
	- **Conservative Risk Appetite:** implies that an organization favors less risk, even if it leads to lower returns
	- **Neutral Risk Appetite:** signifies a balance between risk and return
- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):** essential predictive metrics used by organizations to signal rising risk levels in different parts of the enterprises
	- KRIs help organizations evaluate the impact and likelihood of risks, allowing proactive management to prevent their escalation
- **Risk Owner:** person or group responsible for managing the risk

## Module 9.5: Qualitative Risk Analysis  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain qualitative approaches to risk analysis  
- Recognize common rating methods  

**Key Topics:**  
- Uses descriptive categories (e.g., high/medium/low)  
- Relies on expert judgment and stakeholder input  
- Simpler, faster, less precise 
- **Qualitative Risk Analysis:** a method of assessing risks based on their potential impact and the likelihood of their occurence
	- this method is *subjective and high-level* and relies on the expertise and experience of the project team and stakeholders
	- likelihood and probability refer to the chance of a particular risk occuring
	- the impact refers to the potential consequences if the risk materializes
- the project manager, using **Qualitative Risk Analysis**, might prioritize this risk and develop mitigation strategies

---

## Module 9.6: Quantitative Risk Analysis  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain quantitative approaches to risk analysis  
- Recognize metrics used  

**Key Topics:**  
- Uses numerical values for likelihood and impact  
- Common measures: Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO), Single Loss Expectancy (SLE), Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)  
- Provides cost-benefit basis for decisions 
- **Quantitative Risk Analysis:** objective and numerical evaluation of risks
	- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE):** monetary value expected to be lost in a single event
		- expressed as a percentage between 0-100%
		- calculated by multiplying the value of an asset by the EF: $100,000(asset) x 70% EF = $70,000 SLE
	- **Annualized Rate of Occurence (ARO):** estimated frequency with which a threat is epxected to occur within a year
	- **Anualized Loss Expectancy (ALE):** expected annual loss from a risk (SLE x ARO)
		- ALE = SLE * ARO; ALE = $5,000 * 0.5; ALE = $2,500
	- **Exposure Factor (EF):** proportion of an asset that is lost in an event
		- expressed as a percentage between 0-100%
		- 70% asset loss in catastrophic event = 70% EF

## Module 9.7: Risk Management Strategies  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify risk response options  
- Explain when each strategy is appropriate  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Avoidance:** eliminate activity causing risk  
- **Transference:** shift risk to third parties (e.g., insurance)  
- **Mitigation:** reduce likelihood or impact with controls  
- **Acceptance:** acknowledge risk if cost of mitigation is higher 
- primary risk management strategies: **transfer, accept, avoid, mitigate:**
- **Risk Transference (Risk Sharing):** involves shifting the risk from the organization to another party
	- **Contract Indemnity Clause:** a contractual agreement where one party agrees to cover the other's harm, liability, or loss stemming from the contract
	- risk transference seeks to move the financial burden of a potential loss from one party to another
	- risk transference does not remove the risk but shifts the responsibility for handling its financial consequences
- **Risk Acceptance:** recognizing a risk and choosing to address it when it arises
	- **Exemption:** provision that grants an exception from a specific rule or requirement
	- **Exception:** provision that permits a party to bypass a rule or requirement in certain situations
	- the party is assuming rish either by operating without the safeguards of a rule (**exemption**) or by operating in a way that lets them evade the risk (**exception**)
- **Risk Avoidance:** strategy of altering plans or approaches to completely eliminate a specific risk
- **Risk Mitigation:** implementing measures to decrease the likelihood or impact of a risk
