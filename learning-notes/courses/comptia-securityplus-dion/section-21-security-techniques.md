## Module 21.3: Wireless Security Settings  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize wireless security configuration best practices  
- Explain encryption and authentication methods  

**Key Topics:**  
- WPA3 recommended; WPA2 minimum standard  
- Disable outdated protocols (WEP, TKIP)  
- Use strong authentication (802.1X, RADIUS)  
- Enforce SSID policies and disable WPS  
- **WPA3, AAA, RADIUS, EAP**
- WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3
- Wireles encryption and cryptographic protocols protect wireless networks by securing data from interception
- **Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP):** outdated 1999 wireless security standard meant to match wired LAN security for wireless networks
	- WEP uses a fixed encryption key for all devices on the same network to secure messages
	- 64-bit, 128-bit
	- **128-bit WEP:** includes 104 bits of key data and an additional 24 bits initialization vector
	- WEP is insecure and should be avoided because it's vulnerable to simple cryptographic attacks
	- **WEP:** insecure because of a weak 24-bit intitialization vector
- **Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA):** introduced in 2003 as a temporary improvement over WEP while the more robust IEEE 802.11i standard was in development
	- WPA improved security with TKIP, which generates new 128-bit keys for each packet, eliminating WEP's key-reuse vulnerabilities
	- Due to TKIP vulnerabilities, WPA was susceptible to cryptographic attacks, underscoring the need for advanced wireless security
	- **WPA:** insecure because of the lack of sufficient data integrity checks in the TKIP implementation
- **Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2):** improved data protection and network access control by addressing weaknesses in WPA version
	- WPA2 replaced WPA's TKIP with the AES protocol and adopted CCMP for stronger encryption
	- Counter Cipher Mode with Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP)
	- switching to WPA2 provides stronger encryption and introduces Message Integrity Code (MIC) for integrity checking
- **Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3):** latest version using AES encryption and introducing new features like SAE, Enhanced Open, updated cryptographic protocols, and management protection frames
	- **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE):** enhances security by offering a key establishment protocol to guard against offline dictionary attacks
	- WPA3 provides stronger protection even with weak passwords
	- WPA3 simplifies security setup
- **Enhanced Open/Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE):** major advancement in wireless security, especially for networks using open authentication
	- Enhanced Open improves user privacy and security by guarding against eavesdropping attacks in public Wi-Fi settings
- **Cryptographic Protocol:** uses a newer variant of AES known as the AES GCMP
- **Galois Counter Mode Protocol(GCMP):** supports 128-bit AES for personal networks and 192-bit AES for enterprise networks with WPA3
- **Management Protection Frames:** required to protect network from key recovery attacks
- eavesdropping, forging, tampering
- **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Protocol:** plays a vital role in network security by centralizing user authentication to permit only authorized users to access network resources
- **Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS):** client/server protocol offering AAA services for network users
	- RADIUS is used for secure network access, confirming user identities via a central server and enforcing predefind access rules
	- RADIUS aids in monitoring user activity to ensure accountability and security policy enforcement
- **Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+):** separates the functions of AAA to allow for a more granular control over processes
	- TACACS+ uses TCP and encrypts authentication for improved security over older AAA protocols
- **Authentication Protocols:** confirm user identity for network security and authorized access
	- EAP, PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-FAST
	- **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP):** authentication framework that supports multiple authentication methods
	- **Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP):** authentication protocol that secures EAP within an encrypted and authenticated TLS tunnel
		- certificate (server/client)
	- **Extensible Authentication Protocol-Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS):** authentication protocol that extends TLS support across multiple platforms
		- certificate (server)
	- **Extensible Authentication Protocol-Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST):** developed by Cisco, it enables secure re-authentication while roaming within a network without full authentication each time
		- EAP-FAST was developed to replace LEAP due to security vulnerabilities in the latter
- Summary:
	- WPA3 offers strong protection even with less complex passwords
	- RADIUS network protocol for AAA management of users accessing network services
	- TACACS+ allows granular control over AAA, enhancing security through full authentication encryption
	- EAP: universal authentication framework used to support various authentication methods
