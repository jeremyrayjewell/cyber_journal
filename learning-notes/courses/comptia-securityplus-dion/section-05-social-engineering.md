## Overview  
Section 5 explores social engineering, where attackers exploit human psychology instead of technical vulnerabilities. Learners review motivational triggers, impersonation, pretexting, phishing, influence campaigns, and common scams. The section emphasizes awareness and training as key defenses.

## Module 5.2: Motivational Triggers  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify psychological triggers attackers exploit  
- Recognize examples of manipulation  

**Key Topics:**  
- Urgency and fear (e.g., deadlines, threats of consequences)  
- Authority (attackers posing as superiors or officials)  
- Opportunity or greed (offers of money, prizes, jobs)  
- Sympathy/helpfulness (attackers feigning distress)  
- Familiarity (leveraging relationships or shared details)
- The backbone of social engineering lies in the ability of an attacker to trick a user into doing something for them
- **Types of Motivational Triggers:**
	- Authority: the power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience
	- Urgency: compelling sense of immediacy or time-sensitivity that drives individuals to act swiftly or prioritize certain actions
		- a sense of urgency can be used to get an organization's employees to ignore or bypass their normal security procedures
	- Social Proof: psychological phenomenon where individuals look to the behaviors and actions of others to determine their own decisions or actions in similar situations
	- Scarcity: psychological pressure people feel when they believe a product, opportunity, or resource is limited or in short supply
	- Likability: associated with being nice, friendly, and socially accpted by others
		- sexual attraction, pretending to be a friend, common interest
	- Fear: feeling afraid of someone or something, as likely to be dangerous, painful, or threatening
- Social engineers manipulate users with motivational triggers to execute malicious actions

## Module 5.3: Impersonation  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain impersonation techniques  
- Identify risks of impersonation attacks  

**Key Topics:**  
- Pretending to be a trusted individual: employee, vendor, IT support  
- Mediums: phone, email, in-person  
- Risks: data disclosure, credential theft, unauthorized access  
- Mitigation: verification steps, policies, MFA, security training 
- Impersonation Techniques:
	- Impersonation: an attack where an adversary assumes the identity of another person to gain unauthorized access to resources or steal sensitive data
		- the attacker must first collect information about the organization so that they can more easily earn the trust of their targeted users
		- providing details helps to make the lies and the attacker's impersonation more believable to a potential victim
		- consequences: unauthorized access, disruption of services, complete system takeover
	- Brand Impersonation: specific form of impersonation where an attacker pretends to represent a legitimate company or brand
		- attackers use the brand's logos, language, and info to create deceptive communications or websites
	- Typo-squatting: an attacker registers a domain name that is similar to a popular website but contains some kind of common typographical errors
		- might register a domain like "gnail.com"
		- or registering a hijacked subdomain using the primary domain of a trusted cloud provider, such as azure.com
	- Watering Hole Attacks: targeted form of cyber attack where attackers compromise a specific website or service that their target is known to use

## Module 5.4: Pretexting  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define pretexting and its use in attacks  
- Recognize examples of false credibility  

**Key Topics:**  
- Attackers invent believable stories to extract information  
- Example: “IT technician” requesting login details  
- Often paired with authority or urgency triggers  
- Defense: policies requiring verification and training 
- Train employees not to fall for pretext and not to fill in the gaps for people when they are calling

---

## Module 5.5: Phishing Attacks  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define phishing and recognize its variations  
- Identify phishing techniques  

**Key Topics:**  
- Email phishing: malicious links, attachments, spoofed domains  
- Tactics: typosquatting, urgency, fake branding 
- Types:
	- Phishing: fraudulent attack using deceptive emails from trusted sources to trick individuals into disclosing personal information like passwords and credit card numbers; "spray and pray" (not user-specific)
	- Vishing: voice phishing; phone-based attack in which the attacker deceives victims into divulging personal or financial information
	- Smishing: SMS phishing; uses text messages to deceive individuals into sharing their personal information
	- Whaling: form of spear-fishing that targets high-profile individuals like CEOs or CFOs; often an intitial step to compromise an executive's account for subsequent attacks within their organization
	- Spear Fishing: more tightly focused on a specific group of individuals or organizations; has a higher success rate; targets users
	- Business Email Compromise (BEC): leverages internal email accounts within a company to manipulate employees into carrying out malicious actions for the attacker

## Module 5.6-7: Preventing Phishing Attacks / Conducting an Anti-PHishing  Campaign  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize technical and human defenses against phishing  
- Explain how organizations prepare users  

**Key Topics:**  
- Technical: spam filters, secure gateways, URL filtering, DNS protections  
- Training: awareness programs, reporting suspicious emails  
- Policies: MFA, least privilege, verification requirements 
- Anti-phishing Campaign: vital tool for educating individuals about phishing risks and how to recognize potential phishing attempts in user security awareness training
	- Organizations should regularly provide user security awareness training that covers various phishing techniques
	- generic greetings, spelling and grammar mistakes, spoofed email addresses
	- offer remedial training for users who fell victim to simulated phishing emails
- Indicators: urgency, unusual requests, mismatched URLs, strange email addresses, poor spelling and grammar

- Use of misinformation and disinformation to shape beliefs  
- Platforms: social media, fake news outlets, coordinated accounts  
- Goals: political, financial, or reputational gain  
- Defense: fact-checking, trusted sources, monitoring activity 
- Influence campaigns can foster misinformation and disinformation
- Are coordinated efforts to affect public perception or behavior towards a particular cause, individual, or group
- main ccybersecurity focus is on malicious influence campaigns on high-level actors such as nation-states and hacktivists
	- misinformation: inaccurate information shared unintentionally
	- disinformation: inentional spread of false information to deceive or mislead
- some influence campaigns can also serve an attacker's financial interests
- promoting media literacy, transparency, and regulation can combat misinformation and disinformation

## Module 5.10: Other Social Engineering Attacks
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify other forms of social engineering attacks

**Key Topics:**  
- Diversion Theft: manipulating a situation or creating a distraction to steal valuable items or information
	- user might be prompted to enter sensitive information, such as username, passwords,or credit card details
- Hoaxes: malicious deception that is often spread through social media, email, or other communication channels
- Shoulder Surfing: looking over someone's shoulder to gather personal information
	- high-powered camera or CCTV can make it easy for attackers to steal the victim's information
- Dumpster Diving: searching through trash to find valuable information
	- virtual or digital dumpster diving is also becoming more popular
- Eavesdropping: secretly listening to private conversations
- Baiting: planting malware-infected device for a victim to find and un9ntentionally introduce malware to their organization's system
- Piggybacking or Tailgaiting: both involve an unauthorized person following an authorized person into a secure area; tailgating is following, piggybacking is tricking
	- insider threats typically use piggybacking
