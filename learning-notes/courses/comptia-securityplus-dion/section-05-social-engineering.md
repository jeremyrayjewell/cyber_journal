**Key Topics:**  
- Pretending to be a trusted individual: employee, vendor, IT support  
- Mediums: phone, email, in-person  
- Risks: data disclosure, credential theft, unauthorized access  
- Mitigation: verification steps, policies, MFA 

---

## Module 5.4: Pretexting  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define pretexting and its use in attacks  
- Recognize examples of false credibility  

**Key Topics:**  
- Attackers invent believable stories to extract information  
- Example: “IT technician” requesting login details  
- Often paired with authority or urgency triggers  
- Defense: policies requiring verification and training 

---

## Module 5.5: Phishing Attacks  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define phishing and recognize its variations  
- Identify phishing techniques  

**Key Topics:**  
- Email phishing: malicious links, attachments, spoofed domains  
- Variants: spear phishing, whaling, smishing (SMS), vishing (voice)  
- Tactics: typosquatting, urgency, fake branding 

---

## Module 5.6: Defending Against Phishing  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize technical and human defenses against phishing  
- Explain how organizations prepare users  

**Key Topics:**  
- Technical: spam filters, secure gateways, URL filtering, DNS protections  
- Training: awareness programs, reporting suspicious emails  
- Policies: MFA, least privilege, verification requirements 

---

## Module 5.7: Influence Campaigns  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain influence campaigns as social engineering at scale  
- Recognize motivations and impact  

**Key Topics:**  
- Use of misinformation and disinformation to shape beliefs
