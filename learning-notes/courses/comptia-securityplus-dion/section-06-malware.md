## Module 6.1: Malware Overview  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define malware and explain its purpose  
- Recognize common delivery methods  

**Key Topics:**  
- Malware disrupts systems, steals data, or gains unauthorized access  
- Spread through phishing, malicious websites, drive-by downloads, removable media
- Malware is any software that is designed to infiltrate a compputer system without the user's knowledge; needs to create a threat vector and an attack vector
- Threat Vector: specific method used by an attacker to infiltrate a victim's machine; breaks into the system
	- unpatched software (i.e. MS17-010 security patch)
	- installing code
	- phishing campaign
	- other vulnerabilities
- Attack Vector: a means by which an attacker gains access to a computer to infect the system with malware; breaks into and infects the system
- Virus: malicious software that attaches to clean files and spreads into a computer system
- Worms: stnadalone malware programs that replicate and spread to other systems by exploiting software vulnerabilities
- Botnet: network of zombies and are often used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, or cryptocurrency mining
- Backdoors: malicious means of bypassing normal authentication processes to gain unauthorized access to a system
- Logic Bombs: embed code placed in legitimate programs that executes a malicious action when a specific condition or trigger occurs
- Keyloggers: record a user's keystrokes and are used to capture passwords or other sensitive information
- Spyware: secretly monitors and gathers user information or activities and sends data to third parties
- Bloatware: unnecessary or pre-installed software that consumes system resources and space without offering any value to the user
- Malware Exploitation Techniques: involve methods by which malware infiltrates and infects targeted systems

## Module 6.2: Viruses  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain how viruses operate and spread  
- Identify types of computer viruses  

**Key Topics:**  
- Require user interaction (e.g., opening a file)  
- Types: file-infecting, macro, boot sector  
- Symptoms: corrupted files, pop-ups, crashes 
- Computer Virus: malicious code that's run on a machine without the user's knowledge and this allows the code to infect the computer whenever it has been run
	- simply made up of malicious code that's run on a machine without the user's knowledge and this allows the code to infect the computer whenever it has been run
- Types:
	- Boot Sector: stored in the first sector of a hard drive and is then loaded into memory whenever the computer boots up
		- to find and remove, use an antivuris that specifically looks for boot sector viruses
	- Program: tries to find executables or application files to infect with their malicious code
	- Encrypted: designed to hide itself from being detected by encrypting its malicious code or payloads to avoid detection by any ativirus software
	- Metamorphic: able to rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to infect a given file
	- Armor: have a layer of protection to confuse a program or a person who's trying to analyze it
	- Macro: a form of code that allows a virus to be embedded inside another document so that when that document is opened by the user, the virus is executed
	- Multipartite: a combination of a boot sector type virus and a program virus
		- even is a cybersecurity professional finds the program part of the virus and cleans it out from within the operating system, they may have missed the boot sector portion
	- Polymorphic: advanced version of an encrypted virus, but instead of just encrypting the contents, it will actually change the virus's code each time it is executed by altering the decryption module in order for it to evade detection
	- Stealth: not necessaarily a specific type of virus as much as it is a technique used to prevent the virus from being detected by the anti-virus software
	- Hoax

## Module 6.3: Worms  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define worms and their differences from viruses  
- Identify risks associated with worms  

**Key Topics:**  
- Self-replicating; no user interaction required  
- Exploit network/OS vulnerabilities  
- Consume bandwidth, deploy payloads, enable backdoors
- Worm: piece of malicious software, much like a virus, but it can replicate itself without any user interaction
	- can infect the workstation and other computing assets
	- can cause disruptions to the normal network traffic since they are constantly trying to replicate and spread across the network
	- worms are best known for spreading far and wide over the Internet in a relatively short amount of time
	- **Conficker** is one of the largest worms, because it was able to infect between 9 and 15 milion machines; professionals were able to shut down the attacker's botnet before it was used for any malicious or nefarious purposes
- Worm vs Virus: worms can replicate themselves without any user interaction, viruses require the user to take some action

- Example: fake free software embedding malicious code 
- Trojan: malicious software that is deisguised as a piece of harmless or desirable software
- Remote Access Trojan (RAT): widely used by modern attackers because it provides the attacker with remote control of a victim machine
- trojans are commonly used today by attackers to exploit a vulnerability in a workstation and then conducting data exfiltration
- always be careful to check for Trojans by using a good anti-virus or anti-malware solution prior to opening or installing any programs

- Best practices for prevention:
	- Conducting Regular Backups: backup all of imporant data, files, and systems
	- Installing Regular Software Updates: update all of the software especially operating system and antivuris programs
	- Providing Security Awareness TRaining: provide security awareness training to the end users

- Privilege escalation via software flaws  
- Evasion: packing, polymorphism, disabling security tools 
- some malware focuses on infecting the system's memory to leverage remote procedure calls over the organization's network
- most modern malware uses fireless techniques to avoid detection by signature-based security software
- Fireless Malware: used to create a process in the system memory without relying on the local file system of the infected host
- basic two-stage deployment model of most modern malware:
	- Stage 1: Dropper or Downloader -- when a user clicks on a malicious link or opens a malicious file, malware is installed
		- Dropper: initiates or runs other malware forms within a payload on an infected host
		- Shellcode: encompasses lightweight code meant to execute an exploit on a given target
	- Stage 2: download and install a remote access Trojan to conduct command and control on the victimized system
		- "Actions on Objectives" Phase: Threat actors will execute primary objectives to meet core objectives (data exfiltration or file encryption)
		- Concealment: used to help the threat actor prolong unauthorized access to a system by hiding tracks, erasing log files, and hiding any evidence of malicious activities
- in "living off the land", the threat actors try to exploit the standard system tool to perform instrusion
