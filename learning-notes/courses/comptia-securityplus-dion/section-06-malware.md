---

## Overview  
Section 6 introduces malicious software (malware), its types, and its methods of operation. Learners review common categories including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, keyloggers, rootkits, botnets, and backdoors. The section also examines attack techniques and the indicators that reveal infections.

## Module 6.1: Malware Overview  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define malware and explain its purpose  
- Recognize common delivery methods  

**Key Topics:**  
- Malware disrupts systems, steals data, or gains unauthorized access  
- Spread through phishing, malicious websites, drive-by downloads, removable media
- Malware is any software that is designed to infiltrate a compputer system without the user's knowledge; needs to create a threat vector and an attack vector
- Threat Vector: specific method used by an attacker to infiltrate a victim's machine; breaks into the system
	- unpatched software (i.e. MS17-010 security patch)
	- installing code
	- phishing campaign
	- other vulnerabilities
- Attack Vector: a means by which an attacker gains access to a computer to infect the system with malware; breaks into and infects the system
- Virus: malicious software that attaches to clean files and spreads into a computer system
- Worms: stnadalone malware programs that replicate and spread to other systems by exploiting software vulnerabilities
- Botnet: network of zombies and are often used for DDoS attacks, spam distribution, or cryptocurrency mining
- Backdoors: malicious means of bypassing normal authentication processes to gain unauthorized access to a system
- Logic Bombs: embed code placed in legitimate programs that executes a malicious action when a specific condition or trigger occurs
- Keyloggers: record a user's keystrokes and are used to capture passwords or other sensitive information
- Spyware: secretly monitors and gathers user information or activities and sends data to third parties
- Bloatware: unnecessary or pre-installed software that consumes system resources and space without offering any value to the user
- Malware Exploitation Techniques: involve methods by which malware infiltrates and infects targeted systems

## Module 6.2: Viruses  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain how viruses operate and spread  
- Identify types of computer viruses  

**Key Topics:**  
- Require user interaction (e.g., opening a file)  
- Types: file-infecting, macro, boot sector  
- Symptoms: corrupted files, pop-ups, crashes 

---

## Module 6.3: Worms  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define worms and their differences from viruses  
- Identify risks associated with worms  

**Key Topics:**  
- Self-replicating; no user interaction required  
- Exploit network/OS vulnerabilities  
- Consume bandwidth, deploy payloads, enable backdoors

---

## Module 6.4: Trojans  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain how Trojans deceive users  
- Recognize potential payloads  

**Key Topics:**  
- Disguised as legitimate applications  
- Payloads: backdoors, spyware, ransomware  
- Example: fake free software embedding malicious code 

---

## Module 6.5: Viruses vs. Trojans  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Compare viruses and Trojans  
- Recognize similarities and differences  

**Key Topics:**  
- Viruses replicate, Trojans rely on disguise  
- Both may deliver additional payloads  
- Detection: antivirus, heuristics, behavioral analysis 

---

## Module 6.6: Ransomware  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain ransomware and its impact  
- Identify types and prevention methods  

**Key Topics:**  
- Encrypts files or locks access; demands ransom  
- Types: crypto ransomware and locker ransomware  
- Defenses: backups, endpoint protection, patching, training 

---

## Module 6.7: Zombies and Botnets  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define botnets and how they are controlled  
- Recognize risks of compromised devices  

**Key Topics:**  
- Bots = compromised devices (“zombies”)  
- Botnets used for spam, DDoS, credential attacks  
- Controlled through command-and-control (C2) servers

---

## Module 6.8: Rootkits  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Describe rootkit functionality and risks  
- Recognize difficulty of detection  

**Key Topics:**  
- Conceal processes from OS and security tools  
- Types: kernel, user-mode, firmware  
- Detection: requires specialized tools  
- Defenses: patching, secure boot, EDR 

---

## Module 6.9: Backdoors and Logic Bombs  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define backdoors and logic bombs  
- Identify examples of their use  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Backdoors:** hidden entry points (e.g., test accounts, hardcoded creds)  
- **Logic bombs:** malicious code triggered by an event/time  
- Example: insider-triggered data wipe 

---

## Module 6.10: Keyloggers  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain how keyloggers capture data  
- Identify their risks  

**Key Topics:**  
- Record keystrokes: credentials, credit card numbers  
- Software vs. hardware keyloggers  
- Defenses: AV, endpoint detection, MFA 

---

## Module 6.11: Spyware and Bloatware  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define spyware and bloatware  
- Recognize their effects  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Spyware:** secretly monitors user activity, gathers data  
- **Bloatware:** unnecessary apps slowing systems, creating vulnerabilities  
- Mitigation: whitelisting, monitoring, removal tools 

---

## Module 6.12: Malware Attack Techniques  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify techniques used by malware authors  
- Explain evasion and exploitation strategies  

**Key Topics:**  
- Exploits: phishing, malicious ads, watering hole attacks, drive-by downloads  
- Privilege escalation via software flaws  
- Evasion: packing, polymorphism, disabling security tools 

---

## Module 6.13: Indications of Malware Attacks  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize indicators of compromise (IoCs) for malware  
- Explain how infections are detected  

**Key Topics:**  
- Symptoms: crashes, missing files, abnormal logins, new processes  
- Signs: unusual outbound traffic, tampered logs  
- Defenses: AV scans, SIEM monitoring, IR processes
