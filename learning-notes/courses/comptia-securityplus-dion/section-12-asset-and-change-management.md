- Risks: data leakage, theft, unauthorized access  
- Mitigation: MDM solutions, encryption, strong authentication  
- **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD):** permits employees to use personl devices for work
	- employees own and control the security of their devices
	- personal devices must undergo security checks and have specific software for protecting company data
	- organization might not have the ability to manage or update the device for uers, or enforce stricter security configurations
- **Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE):** involves the company providing a mobile device to employees for both work and personal use
	- COPE standardizes device management but may be expensive for employers providing devices to staff
- **Choose Your Own Device (CYOD):** offers a middle ground between BYOD and COPE by allowing employees to choose devices from a company-approved list
	- CYOD has higher intial costs for the organization and raises employee data privacy concerns
- *costs, security, employee satisfaction*
	- BYOD is cost-effective, but hidden costs may arise related to security and compatibility
	- COPE and CYOD have higher upfront costs but save on ongoing support due to fewer supported device models
	- CYOD provides optimal control over devices and enables management through the organization's MDM solution
	- BYOD and CYOD models are suitable for prioritizing employees' freedom and choice
