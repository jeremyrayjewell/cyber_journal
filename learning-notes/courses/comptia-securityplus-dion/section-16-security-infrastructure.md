	- install a firewall in a network to set up a screened subnet
- a firewall with in-depth inspection may slow down the device due to the time taken for each packet to pass through all the rules
- **Packet Filtering Firewall:** checks packet headers for traffic allowance based on IP addresses and port numbers
	- packet filtering firewalls cannot prevent certain attacks due to limited inspection capabilities in the packet header
- **Stateful Firewall:** monitors all inbound and outbound network connections and requests

## Module 16.8: Securing Network Communications  
**Learning Objectives:**

- Recognize encryption and tunneling protocols  

**Key Topics:**  
- VPNs with IPSec or SSL/TLS  
- Secure protocols: HTTPS, SSH, SFTP  
- Segmentation and tunneling for confidentiality and integrity  
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN):** extends a private network over a public one, enabling users to securely send and receive data
	- **Site-to-site VPN:** establishes secure tunnels over the public Internet for interconnecting remote sites
		- site-to-site VPN secures traffic, but may slow down users due to extra data transfer
	- **Client-to-site VPN:** connects individual devices directly to the organization's headquarters, enabling remote users to access the network
		- **Full Tunnel:** maximizes security by encrypting all traffic to the headquarters while integrating clients with the network
		- **Split Tunnel:** divides traffic and network requests and then routes them to the appropriate network
		- a client-to-site VPN with split tunnel decides which traffic goes through the VPN, encrypting data for headquarters' network access
		- split tunnel combines encrpyted VPN path to headquarters with a direct, unencrypted Internet path for everything else
		- **Full Tunnel** offers more security, **Split Tunnel** offers better performance
	- **Clientless VPN:** secures remote access through browser-based VPN tunnels without needing client software or hardware configuration
- **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** a protocol that provides cryptographic security for secure connections and is used for secure web browsing and data transfer
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** used by TLS to establish secure connections between a client and a server, but it may slow down the connection
- **Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS): a UDP-based version of TLS protocol that offers the same security level as TLS while maintaining faster operations
	- DTLS ensures end-user security and protects against eavesdropping in clientless VPN connections
- **Internet Protocol SEcurity (IPSec):** a protocol suite for secure communication through authentication and data encryption in IP networks
	- confidentiality, integrity, authentication, anti-replay
- **Steps in establishing and using a secure VPN tunnel:**
	- *Request to start Internet Key Exchange (IKE):* PC1 initiates traffic to PC2, triggering IPSec tunnel creation by RTR1
	- *IKE Phase 1:* RTR1 and RTR2 negotiate security associations for the IPSec IKE Phase 1 (ISAKMP) tunnel
	- *IKE Phase 2:* IKE Phase 2 establishes a tunnel within the tunnel
	- *Data transfer:* data transfer between PC1 and PC2 takes place securely
	- *Tunnel termination:*	tunnel termination, including the deletion of IPSec security associations
- **Transport Mode:** employs the original IP header, ideal for client-to-site VPNs, and is advantageous when dealing with MTU contraints
	- **Maximum Transission Unit (MTU):** is set only at 1500 bytes and may cause fragementation and VPN problems
- **Tunneling Mode:** employed for site-to-site VPNs and adds an extra header that can increase packet size and exceed the MTU
	- at the destination site, the VPN concentrator removes the outer header, decrypts the content, and routes it internally
	- in tunneling mode, packets are encapsulated within new ones, potentially exceeding the 1500-byte limit of MTU
	- site-to-site VPNs may require support for jumbo frames above an MTU of 1500 bytes
	- lower the inner router's MTU to ~1400 bytes if jumbo frames cannot be utilized
	- adjusting the MTU to 9000 bytes is feasible in local area networks but not recommended for Internet due to potential issues
- **Authentication Header (AH):** offers connectionless data integrity and data origin authentication for IP datagrams using cryptographic hash and indentification information
- **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP):** employed for providing authentication, integrity, replay protection, and data confidentiality by enrypting the packet's payload
	- in transport mode, use the authentication header for TCP header integrity, then add ESP to encrypt header and payload
	- in tunneling mode, employ both the authentication header and the encapsulated security payload
