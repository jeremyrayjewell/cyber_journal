## Module 25.2: Investigating with Data  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the role of data in investigations  
- Recognize key data sources  

**Key Topics:**  
- Data from logs, captures, scans, and reports  
- Correlation across sources builds a complete picture  
- Accuracy depends on integrity and timeliness of data  
- **Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM):** combination of different data sources into one tool that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware
- sensor, sensitivity, trends, alerts, correlation
- **Log File:** a file that records either events that occur in an operating system or other software that runs, or messages between different users of a communications software
	- network, system, application, security, web, DNS, authentication, dump files, VoIP, call managers
- **Syslog/Rsyslog/Syslog-ng:** variations of syslog which all permit the logging of data from different types of systems in a central repository
- **Journalctl:** Linux command line utility used for querying and displaying logs from the journald, which is responsible for managing and storing log data on a Linux machine
- **NXLog:** a multi-platform log management tool that helps to easily identify security risks, policy breaches, or analyze operational problems
	- server logs, operational system logs, application logs
- *Rsyslog/Syslog-ng:* Linux and Unix, *NXlog:* Unix, Linux, and Windows
- **NetFlow:** network protocol system created by Cisco that collects active IP network traffic as it flows in or out of an interface, including its point of origin, destination, volume, and paths on the network
	- point of origin, destination, volume, paths
- **Sampled Flow (SFlow):** provides a means for exporting truncated packets, together with interface counters for the purpose of network monitoring
- **Internet Protocol Flow Information Export (IPFIX):** universal standard of export for Internet Protocol flow information from rrouters, probes, and other devices that are used by mediation systems, accounting and billing systems, and network management systems to facilitate services
- **Metadata:** data that describes other data by providing an underlying definition or description by summarizing basic information about data that makes finding and working with particular instances of data easier
	- email, mobile, web, file

## Module 25.3: Dashboards  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize the role of dashboards

---

## Module 25.4: Automated Reports  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define automated reporting in investigations  
- Recognize benefits  

**Key Topics:**  
- Automatically generated summaries from monitoring systems  
- Provide regular status updates or alerts  
- Save time while supporting compliance and incident documentation  
- **Automated Report:** computer-generated report created automatically
	- the executive summary condenses the contents of reports, which vary in length based on network activity
	- maliicious, suspicious, benign

---

## Module 25.5: Vulnerability Scans  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain use of vulnerability scans in investigations  
- Recognize limitations  

**Key Topics:**  
- Identify weaknesses that may have been exploited  
- Scans help correlate vulnerabilities with attack paths  
- Must be paired with logs and forensic data  
- **Vulnerability Scan:** generate scan reports automatically
	- review the vulnerability scan results to confirm if the detected vulnerabilities actually exist in the system
	- critical, high, medium, low
	- prioritize vulnerable hosts starting from the most critical to aid in addressing them efficiently
	- to secure systems, update vulnerable security patch if RDP is essential for remote desktop support
	- **Authenticated Attacker:** insider threat
	- **Unauthenticated Attacker:** anyone
	- RDP impacts individual workstations, while Exchange servers affect the entire organization's email services
- when updating isn't an option, alternative compensating controls are necessary for addressing vulnerabilities
- review the vulnerability scan report thoroughly beyond automated rankings based on CVE posture or CVSS scores

## Module 25.6: Packet Captures  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define packet capture analysis  
- Recognize its value  

**Key Topics:**  
- Provides raw network traffic for deep analysis  
- Identifies malicious communication, exfiltration, or command-and-control activity  
- Requires careful filtering and forensic expertise  
- **Packet Capture:** gathers all data sent to or from a specific network device
- attacker initiates a SYN packet for a half-open connection but does not complete the action
- a distributed denial of service attack occurs when half-open connections consume server resources

---

## Module 25.7: Firewall Logs  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain use of firewall logs in incident investigation  
- Recognize key details  

**Key Topics:**  
- Record allowed/blocked traffic across network boundaries  
- Provide visibility into attempted intrusions and policy violations  
- Help track attacker IPs and suspicious connections
- **Standard firewall log**, **Web application firewall log**

- Useful for correlating intrusion attempts with other data sources  
- Which of the following event IDs represents the biggest threat to your organization's enterprise network and should be investigated immediately by the organization's cybersecurity analysts?
- blocked attacks are not a major concern because defenses have stopped them
- it is important to identify the sources of the blocked attacks
- echo requests could create some network congestion, but it is not as critical as a data breach
- **Blocked:** mitigated and no effect on the network
- **Not alerted or monitored:** bypassed the network security appliiance and affected the network
