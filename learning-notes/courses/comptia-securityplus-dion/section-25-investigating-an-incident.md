- Requires careful filtering and forensic expertise  

---

## Module 25.7: Firewall Logs  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain use of firewall logs in incident investigation  
- Recognize key details  

**Key Topics:**  
- Record allowed/blocked traffic across network boundaries  
- Provide visibility into attempted intrusions and policy violations  
- Help track attacker IPs and suspicious connections  

---

## Module 25.8: Application Logs  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain application log analysis  
- Recognize common findings  

**Key Topics:**  
- Record user activity, errors, authentication attempts  
- Reveal misuse of applications or exploitation attempts  
- Support detection of SQLi, XSS, and privilege misuse  

---

## Module 25.9: Endpoint Logs  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define endpoint log role in investigations  
- Recognize examples  

**Key Topics:**  
- OS events, antivirus alerts, EDR data  
- Reveal malware activity, persistence, or lateral movement  
- Correlated with other logs for full scope  

---

## Module 25.10: OS-specific Security Logs  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize OS security logs  
- Explain their investigative role  

**Key Topics:**  
- Windows: Event Viewer (logon, policy changes, system events)  
- Linux: syslog, auth.log, journalctl  
- Provide insight into access and privilege activity  

---

## Module 25.11: IDS/IPS Logs  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define IDS/IPS logs  
- Recognize their importance  

**Key Topics:**  
- Record detected threats and blocked traffic  
- Provide attack signatures and timestamps  
- Useful for correlating intrusion attempts with other data sources  

---

## Module 25.12: Network Logs  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain network log analysis  
- Recognize their content  

**Key Topics:**  
- Router, switch, and access point logs  
- Reveal traffic anomalies and configuration issues  
- Support detection of lateral movement or unusual flows  

---

## Module 25.13: Metadata  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define metadata in investigations  
- Recognize its value  

**Key Topics:**  
- Metadata provides “data about data” (timestamps, source, destination, file attributes)  
- Supports timeline creation and event correlation  
- Critical in forensic reconstruction of incidents
