## Module 20.2: Changing Default Configurations  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain risks of default settings  
- Recognize common changes needed  

**Key Topics:**  
- Default passwords and settings are widely known  
- Must disable or modify defaults to prevent compromise  
- Includes renaming admin accounts, changing ports, adjusting default access  
- default passwords, unneeded ports and protocols, extra open ports
- default passwords: choose a long, strong, and unique password for maximum protection
- disable any unneeded ports and protocols on the system
	- **SMTP:** port 25
- check for any open ports on the devices
	- several devices have ports 22, 23, 80 and 443 open by default upon initial power-up
		- **SSH:* port 22, **Telnet:** port 23, **HTTP:** port 80, **HTTPS:** port 443

- Prevent unauthorized software from executing  
- Supports least functionality principle  
- **Least Functionality:** a process of configuring a workstation or server with only essential applications and services for the user
	- restrict, uninstall
- **Secure Baseline Image:** a standardized workstation setup, including OS, essential applications, and strict policies in corporate networks
- **Allowlisting:** a security measure that permits only approved applications to run on an operating system
	- Allowlisting, in terms of access control, functions much like an Explicit Allow Statement, from Network+ studies
	- more secure but complex to manage
	- blocks everything except listed applications
- **Blocklisting:** entails preventing listed applications from running, allowing all others to execute
	- easier to manage but less secure
	- allwos everthing except listed applications

	- **Trusted Solaris:** offers secure, multi-level operations with MAC, detailed system audits, and data/process compartmentalization
	- **Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 4:** the operating system was carefully designed, tested, and reviewed, offering good security assurance
- Trusted OS enhances security with microkernels by minimizing the trusted base and reducing attack surface and vulnerabilities
	- usability, performance, functional requirements

**Key Topics:**  
- Regular patching reduces vulnerabilities  
- Must test before deployment to avoid disruptions  
- Includes OS, applications, firmware  
- manual, automated
- **Hotfix:** a software patch that solves a security issue and should be applied immediately after being tested in a lab environment
- **Update:** provides a system with additional functionality, but it does not usually provide any patching of security related issues
- **Service Pack:** includes all the hotfixes and updates since the release of the operating system
	- assign a dedicated team to track vendor security patches
	- establish automated system-wide patching for OS and applications
	- include cloud resources in the patch management
	- categorize patches as urgent, important, or non-critical for prioritization
	- create a test environment to verify critical patches before production deployment
	- establish a process for evaluating, testing, and deploying firmware updates
	- develop a technical process for deploying approved urgent patches to productino
	- periodically assess non-critical patches for combined rollout

## Module 20.9: SELinux  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)  
- Recognize its capabilities  

**Key Topics:**  
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC) framework for Linux  
- Restricts processes and users beyond discretionary access controls  
- Provides fine-grained security enforcement  
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):** system-enforced access control mechanism that's based on subject clearance and the object labels
- **Context-based Permissions:** permission schemes that are defined by various properties for a given file or process
- **SELinux**, **AppArmor**
- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** each object has a list of entities that are allowed to access it 
- **SELinux:** default context-based permission scheme that's included inside of CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
	- SELinux is used to enforce MAC on processes and resources and enables information to be classified and protected
	- **User:** defines what users can access an object
		- Unconfined_u (all users)
		- User_u (unprivileged user)
		- Sysadmin_u (system administrators)
		- Root (root user)
	- **Role:** defines what roles can access a given object
	- **Type:** groups objects together that have similar security requirements or characteristics
	- **Level:** used to describe the sensitivity level of a given file, directory, or process
		- **Disabled:** SELinux is essentially turned off, and so MAC is not going to be implemented
		- **Enforcing:** all the SELinux security policies are being enforced
		- **Permissive:** SELinux is enabled, but the security policies are not enforced
	- targeted policies, strict policies
	- violation occurs when an attempt to access an object or an action goes against an existing policy
	- *SELinux* is only as strong as the restricted profiles being created

## Module 20.10: Data Encryption Levels  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain different encryption levels  
- Recognize their applications  

**Key Topics:**  
- Encryption at rest, in transit, and in use  
- Protects confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data  
- Must align with compliance and business needs  
- **Data Encryption:** process of converting data into a secret code to prevent unauthorized access
	- **Full-disk Encryption:** encrypts the entire hard drive to protect all of the data being stored on it
	- **Partition Encryption:** similar to full-disk encryption, but it is only applied to a specific partition on the storage device
		- **VeraCrypt:** users can selectively encrypt partitions, like sensitive documents, while leaving the OS partition unencrypted
	- **Volume Encryption:** used to encrypt a set space on the storage medium, creating an encrypred container that can house various files and folders
	- **File-level Encryption:** used to encrypt an individual file instead of an entire partition or an entire disk drive
		- **GNU Privacy Guard (GPG):** provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication
	- **Database Encryption:** secures the entire database, extending to multiple storage devices or cloud storage, similar to full-disk encryption
		- **SQL Server Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):** auto-encrypts the entire database without needing application changes, as the system handles encryption and decryption
	- **Record-level Encryption:** used to encrypt individual records or rows within a database
