# CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) Complete Course & Practice Exam  
## Section 4 â€“ Physical Security  

[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/)  
---

## Overview  
Section 4 examines physical security measures used to deter, delay, and prevent unauthorized access to facilities. Learners study controls such as fencing, bollards, locks, vestibules, and surveillance systems, as well as methods attackers use to bypass them, including brute force entry and access badge cloning.

## Module 4.1: Physical Security Basics  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define physical security and its role in cybersecurity  
- Identify categories of physical controls  

**Key Topics:**  
- Physical security: measures taken to protect tangible assets, like buildings, equipment, and people, from harm or unauthorized access 
	- protects people, facilities, and information  
- Examples: fencing and bollards, attacking with brute force, surveillance systems, bypassing surveillance systems, access control vestibules  
- Complements technical and administrative controls

---

## Module 4.2: Fencing and Bollards  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the purpose of fencing and bollards  
- Identify situations where each is appropriate  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Fencing:** structure that encloses an area using interconnected panels or posts 
	- defines boundaries, deters casual intruders, delays attackers  
	- trespassing, theft, vandalism, unauthorized access
- **Bollards:** robust, short vertical posts, made of steel or concrete, that are designed to manage or redirect vehicular traffic 
	- prevent vehicle-based attacks or forced entry  
	- used to keep vehicles away from buildings so that if an IED explodes nearby, the building and people are safe
	- clear visual reminder of where vehicles are not permitted
	- ASTM F2656-07 M30 P1: can stop a 15,000-pound vehicle traveling at 30 mph and not allow a vehicle to move for more than 1m after hitting
- **Attacking with Brute Force:**
	- forcible entry: gaining unauthorized access to a space by physically breaking or bypassing its barriers, such as windows, doors, or fences
		- use reinforced or laminated windows to provide resistance against brute force attacks
		- use high-strength doors with deadbolt locks, metal frames, or a solid core
	- tampering with security devices: involves manipulating security devices to create new vulnerabilities that can be exploited
		- to protect against tampering with security devices, have redundancy in physical security measures
	- confronting security personnel: involves the direct confrontation or attack of security personnel
		- seucirty personnel undergo rigorous conflict resolution and self-defense training to mitigate risks
	- ramming a barrier with a vehicle: brute force attack that uses a car, truck, or other motorized vehicle to ram into the organization's physical security barriers
		- brute force attacks on physical security are a direct, often violent approach to bypassing security measures
- **Surveillance Systems:**

## Module 4.3: Access Control Vestibules  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Describe how vestibules (mantraps) support access control  
- Recognize how they reduce tailgating and piggybacking  

**Key Topics:**  
- Two sets of interlocked doors controlling entry  
- Authentication required at each stage  
- May integrate biometrics or badge readers

---

## Module 4.4: Door Locks  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Compare lock types and their vulnerabilities  
- Understand use cases for mechanical vs. electronic locks  

**Key Topics:**  
- Types: mechanical deadbolts, electronic locks, biometric locks  
- Weaknesses: picking, brute force, or poor installation  
- Security strengthened when combined with logging or MFA

---

## Module 4.5: Surveillance Systems  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the role of surveillance in security monitoring  
- Recognize limitations and bypasses  

**Key Topics:**  
- Systems: CCTV, IP cameras, DVR/NVR  
- Sensors: infrared, ultrasonic, microwave, pressure-based  
- Weaknesses: blind spots, tampering, poor resolution  
- Countermeasures: redundancy, proper placement

---

## Module 4.6: Attacks on Physical Controls  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify methods used to bypass physical defenses  
- Understand risks from cloned badges and forced entry  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Brute force:** physically breaking locks or barriers  
- **Badge cloning:** duplicating access cards to bypass authentication  
- **Surveillance evasion:** exploiting blind spots, disabling systems  
- Mitigation: stronger locks, multifactor authentication, redundant surveillance, guards 

---

## Completion Status  
- All Section 4 materials reviewed  
- Flashcards created for physical controls and bypass techniques
