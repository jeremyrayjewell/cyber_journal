---

## Overview  
Section 24 covers incident response processes, including threat hunting, forensic analysis, and testing response readiness. Learners explore structured incident response frameworks, root cause analysis, and digital forensic procedures to manage and recover from security incidents effectively.  

---

## Module 24.1: Incident Response Overview  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define incident response (IR)  
- Recognize its goals  

**Key Topics:**  
- Structured approach for detecting, containing, and recovering from incidents  
- Protects confidentiality, integrity, and availability  
- Ensures lessons learned to strengthen defenses  
- **Incident Response Process:** outlines a structured approach to manage and mitigate security incidents effectively
	- minimize impact, reduce response time, hasten recovery
	- incident detection and classification, threat containment and eradication, evidence preservation, communication and reporting, lessons learned
- incident response overview, threat hunting, root cause analysis, incident response training and testing, digital forensic procedures, disk imaging and analysis

## Module 24.2: Incident Response Process  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain stages of the IR process  
- Recognize their importance  

**Key Topics:**  
- Common framework: **Preparation → Detection → Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned**  
- Provides repeatable and structured response  
- Reduces impact, speeds recovery  
- **Incident:** act of violating an explicit or implied security policy
- **Incident Response Procedures:** guidelines for handling security incidents
	- **Preparation:** involves strengthening systems and networks to resist attacks
		- the preparation phase is about getting readyy for future incidents
	- **Detection:** identifies security incidents
	- **Analysis:** involves a thorough examination and evaluation of the incident
		- stakeholders are informed, containment begins, and initial response actions are taken
	- **Containment:** limits the incident's impact by securring data and protecting business operations
	- **Eradication:** starts after containment and aims to remove malicious activity from the system or network
	- **Recovery:** restores systems and services to their secure state after an incident
		- restoring from a known good backup, installing security patches, implementing configuration updates
		- recovery procedures can involve monitoring for lingering threats to ensure a smooth return to normal operations
	- **Post-incident activity/Lessons learned:** happens after containment, eradication, and full system recovery
- **Root Cause Analysis:** idnetifies the incident's source and how to prevent it in the future
	- define/scope the incident, determine the casual relationships that led to the incident, identify an effective solution, implement and track the solutions
- **Lessons Learned Process:** documents experiences during incidents in a formalized way
- **After-action Report:** collects formalized information about what occurred
	- incident response and recovery are crucial in organizations due to frequent major data breaches in the news
	- large organizations have full-time incident response teams, while smaller ones form temproary teams for specifc incidents
	- leader, subject-matter experts, IT support staff, legal counsel, human resources, public relations
	- leadership and management ensure the incident response team has necessary funding, resources, and expertise
	- management makes crucial decisions and communicates them during incident response
		- expensive, unfamiliar

## Module 24.3: Threat Hunting  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define threat hunting  
- Recognize its role in IR  

**Key Topics:**  
- Proactive search for adversaries before alerts are triggered  
- Involves analyzing logs, threat intel, and anomalies  
- Complements reactive detection methods  

---

## Module 24.4: Root Cause Analysis  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define root cause analysis (RCA)  
- Recognize its benefits  

**Key Topics:**  
- Identifies the origin of an incident, not just symptoms  
- Prevents recurrence by addressing underlying issues  
- Uses techniques like the “5 Whys” and fault tree analysis  

---

## Module 24.5: Incident Response Training and Testing  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the role of training and testing in IR  
- Recognize methods used  

**Key Topics:**  
- Tabletop exercises, simulations, red team/blue team drills  
- Ensures teams are prepared and roles are clear  
- Validates effectiveness of incident response plans  

---

## Module 24.6: Digital Forensic Procedures  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define digital forensics in IR  
- Recognize forensic best practices  

**Key Topics:**  
- Preserves and analyzes digital evidence for investigations  
- Chain of custody critical for admissibility  
- Forensic tools used to analyze logs, memory, storage  

---

## Module 24.7: Data Collection Procedures  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize methods for data collection  
- Explain integrity preservation  

**Key Topics:**  
- Collect logs, network captures, system images, memory dumps  
- Data must be preserved without alteration  
- Documented process ensures reliability  

---

## Module 24.8: Disk Imaging and Analysis  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define disk imaging  
- Recognize its use in forensics  

**Key Topics:**  
- Exact copy of a storage device for investigation  
- Preserves evidence while original remains untouched  
- Analysis reveals malware, deleted files, hidden partitions
