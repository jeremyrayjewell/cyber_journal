- Complements reactive detection methods  

---

## Module 24.4: Root Cause Analysis  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define root cause analysis (RCA)  
- Recognize its benefits  

**Key Topics:**  
- Identifies the origin of an incident, not just symptoms  
- Prevents recurrence by addressing underlying issues  
- Uses techniques like the “5 Whys” and fault tree analysis  

---

## Module 24.5: Incident Response Training and Testing  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the role of training and testing in IR  
- Recognize methods used  

**Key Topics:**  
- Tabletop exercises, simulations, red team/blue team drills
