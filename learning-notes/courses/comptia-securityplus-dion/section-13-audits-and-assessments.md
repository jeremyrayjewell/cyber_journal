## Module 13.4: External Audits and Assessments  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the role of external audits  
- Recognize compliance drivers  

**Key Topics:**  
- Conducted by third-party auditors or regulators  
- Required for regulatory compliance (PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO standards)  
- Provide objectivity, certification, and external accountability  
- **External Audit:** systematic evaluation carried out by external entities to assess an organization's information systems and controls
	- data protection, network security, access controls, incident response
	- the aim of an external audit is to uncover deficiencies in policies and controls to ensure alignment with diverse regulatory standards
		- GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS
- **External Assessment:** detailed analysis conducted by independent entities to identify vulnerabilities and risks 
	- risk assessment, vulnerability assessment, threat assessment
	- **regulatory compliance:** objective that organizations aim to reach in adherence to applicable laws, policies, and regulations
		- compliance involves adhering to industry-specific requirements (e.e., HIPAA and PCI DSS) and broader regulations like GDPR
	- **examination:** comprehensive security infrastructure inspections that conducted externally
		- examinations review policies, procedures, and controls, and address weaknesses
		- industry-specific examinations can also arise based on sector regulations
	- **Independent Third-party Audit:** offers validation of security practices, fostering trust with customers, stakeholders, and regulatory authorities
		- GDPR and PCI DSS mandate regular third-party independent audits as part of compliance obligations for organizations

## Module 13.5: Performing an External Assessment  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify the process of external evaluations  
- Recognize challenges and benefits  

**Key Topics:**  
- Steps: scope definition, evidence collection, analysis, reporting  
- Benefits: impartiality, credibility, compliance assurance  
- Challenges: cost, time, operational disruption  
- Governance, Risk, Compliance practices
- **External assessments** are seeking to get a quick overview of the orgnization's current risk posture through a truly independent, third-party assessor

## Module 13.6: Penetration Testing  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define penetration testing and its purpose  
- Recognize pen testing phases  

**Key Topics:**  
- Simulated attacks to test defenses  
- Goals: identify exploitable vulnerabilities, measure response capability  
- Phases: planning, reconnaissance, exploitation, reporting  
- **Penetration Testing (Pentesting):** simulated cyber attack that helps in the assessment of computer systems for exploitable vulnerabilities
	- **Physical Pentesting:** testing an organization's physical security through testing locks, access cards, security cameras, and other protective measures
		- a physical pentest aims to find weaknesses in an organization's physical security and suggest enhancements to bolster it
		- identify physical vulnerabilities, improve security awareness, prevent unauthorized access
	- **Offensive Pentest (Red Teaming):** proactive approach that involves use of attack techniques, akin to real cyber threats, that seek and exploit system vulnerabilities
		- offensive pentesting simulates real-world attacks so the organizations learn to recognize and defend against such threats
	- **Defensive Pentesting (Blue Teaming):** reactive approach that entails fortifying systems, idnetifying and addressing attacks, and enhancing incident response times
		- improve incident response time, strengthen systems, enhance detection capabilities
	- **Integrated Pentesting (Purple Teaming):** combination of aspects of both offensive and defensive testing into a single penetration test
		- integration pentesting promotes teamwork by facilitating security assessment and attack-response simulations

## Module 13.7: Reconnaissance in Penetration Testing  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain reconnaissance techniques  
- Identify passive vs. active recon  

**Key Topics:**  
- Passive: OSINT, reviewing public data, social media, DNS lookups  
- Active: scanning, probing, enumeration  
- Provides intelligence for later exploitation  
- **Reconnaissance:** an initial phase where critical information about a target system is gathered to enhance an attack's effectiveness and success
	- reconnaissance is a crucial step in penetration testing
	- **Active Reconnaissance:** direct engagement with the target system, ofering more information but with a higher detection risk
	- **Passive Reconnaissance:** gathering information without direct engagement with the target system, offering lower detection risk but less data
	- reconnaissance necessity and extent depend on the test type and environment
	- **Known Environment:** detailed target infrastructure information from the organization is received prior to the test
		- focuses on known assets, evaluates vulnerabilitiies and weaknesses, aims to understand exploitability and potential damages, resembles an insider threat scenario
	- **Partially Known Environment:** involves limited information provided to testers, who may have partial knowledge of the system
		- partially known environment testing aims to identify vulnerabilities in both known and hidden assets
	- **Unkown Environment:** testers receive minimal to no information about the target system
		- unknown environment testing aims to mimic an external attacker with limited knowledge
- Reconnaissance is a critical first step in penetration testing
