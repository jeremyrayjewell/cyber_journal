	- operating system, middleware, runtime, data, application
- **Third-Party Vendors:** provide specialized services that enhance the functionality, security, and efficiency of cloud solutions
- **Hybrid Solutions:** combine on-premise inrastructure, private cloud services, and public cloud services
	- data security, compliance, interoperability, cost
	- sensitive data is protected, regulatory requirements are met, systems can communicate with each other, the solution is cost-effective
- **On-Premise Solutions:** computing infrastructure that's physically located on-site at business
	- **availability:** system's ability to be accessed when needed 
	- **resilience:** system's ability to recover from failure and continue to function 
	- **cost:** it's ssential to consider both the immediate and long-term costs of cloud adoption
	- **responsiveness:** speed at which the system can adapt to changes in demand
	- **scalability:** system's ability to handle increased workloads 
	- **ease of deployment:** cloud services are easier to deploy than on-premie solutions 
	- **risk transference:** when using the cloud services, some risks are transferred to the provider
	- **ease of recovery:** cloud services often offer easy data recovery and backup solutions 
	- **patch availability:** cloud service providers regularly release patches to fix vulnerabilities 
	- **inability to patch:** businesses might not be able to apply patches due to compatibility issues 
	- **power:** customers don't have to worry about power consumption 
	- **compute:** amount of computational resources that a customer can use

## Module 15.3: Cloud Security  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain challenges of cloud security  
- Recognize best practices  

**Key Topics:**  
- Shared responsibility model  
- Risks: misconfigurations, data breaches, vendor lock-in  
- Defenses: encryption, strong IAM, monitoring, compliance alignment  
- **Shared Physical Server Vulnerabilities:** can lead to vulnerabilities if one user's data is compromised
- **Inadequate Virtual Environment Security:** can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents
	- using secure VM templates, regularly updating and patching VMs, monitoring VMs for unusual activities
- **User Access Management:** can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems
	- enforcing strong password policies, using multi-factor authentication, limiting user permissions based on the principle of least privilege, monitoring user activities for any suspicious behavior
- **Lack of Up-to-date Security Measures:** can lead to leaving the system vulnerable to new threats
	- keeping software and systems patched, regularly reviewing and updating security policies, staying informed about the latest threats and security best practices
- **Single Points of Failure:** can lead to a complete system outage affecting all users
	- servers, data centers, cloud providers
- **Weak Authentication and Encryption Practices:** can lead to allowing unauthorized users to gain access to cloud systems
	- multi-factor authentication, strong encryption algorithms, secure key management practices
- **Unclear Policies:** lack of clear guidelines or procedures for various security aspects
- **Data Remnants:** residual data left behind after deletion or erasure processes
	- using secure deletion methods that overwrite data, managing backups securely, verifying that data has been completely removed after deletion
