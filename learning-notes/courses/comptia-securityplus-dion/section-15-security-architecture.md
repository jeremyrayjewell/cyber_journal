- Explain SDN principles  
- Recognize benefits and risks  

**Key Topics:**  
- Separates control plane from data plane  
- Benefits: agility, centralized management  
- Risks: centralized attack targets, misconfiguration impact  
- Requires controller security and segmentation  

---

## Module 15.9: Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define IaC and its benefits  
- Recognize risks of insecure configurations  

**Key Topics:**  
- Managing infrastructure through code and automation
