## Module 8.1: Cryptographic Solutions Overview  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define cryptography and its functions in security  
- Recognize the four core goals of cryptography  

**Key Topics:**  
- Confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation  
- Applications: secure communication, digital signatures, certificates 
- **Cryptography:** practice and study of writing and solving codes to hide the true meaning of the information
- **Encryption:** process of converting ordinary information (plaintext) into an unintelligible form (ciphertext)
- data at rest: inactive data that is being archived
- data in transit: data that moves across the network, resides inside RAM, or moves to and from the processor
- data in use: data undergoing a current constant state of change
- ROT13
- A cipher is an algorithm that performs the cnryption or decryption
- Algorithms: mathematical function
- Encryption strength comesf rom the key, not the algorithm
- Key: essential piece of information that determines the output of a cipher; the 'key' to security inside encryption is the actual key itself
	- use larger key lengths and rotate keys frequently
	- the length of a key is proportional to the level of security it provides
	- regularly changing cryptographic keys is a best practice
	- most encryption algorithms are open-source and publicly accessible
	- store in secure hardware modules, encrypt keys when at rest, transmit keys securely when used
	- limit key access to regular audits and monitoring
- asymmetric algorithms: use a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption
- symmetric algorithms: use the same key for both encryption and decryption

## Module 8.2: Symmetric vs. Asymmetric  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Compare symmetric and asymmetric encryption  
- Identify advantages and limitations of each  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Symmetric:** single shared key; fast, but requires secure key distribution  
- **Asymmetric:** public/private key pairs (different than one another); enables key exchange, slower performance  
- Use together in hybrid solutions (e.g., SSL/TLS) 
- **Symmetric Algorithm (Private Key):** encryption algorithm in which both the sender and the receiver must know the same shared secret using a privately held key
- **Asymmetric Algorithm (Public Key):** encryption algorithm where different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the data	
	- Diffie-Hellman
	- RSA (Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman)
	- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
- **Hybrid Implementation:** utilizes asymmetric encryption to securely transfer a private key that can then be used with symmetric encryption
- algorithms can also be classified as **stream cipher** or **block cipher**:
	- stream cipher: utilizes a keystream generator to encrypt data bit by bit using a mathematical XOR function to create the ciphertext
	- block cipher: breaks the input into fixed-length blocks of data and performs the encryption on each block; typically of 64, 128, or 256 bits, rather than one bit at a time

	- **Data Encryption Standard (DES):** breaks the input into 64-bit blocks and uses transposition and substitution to create ciphertext using an effective key strength of only 56-bits
	- **Triple DES (3DES):** uses three se[arate symmetric keys to encrypt, decrypt, then encrypt the plaintext into ciphertext in order to increase the strength of DES
	- **International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA):** symmetric block cipher which uses 64-bit blocks to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext
	- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):** symmetric block cipher that uses 128-bit, 192-bit, or 356-bit blocks and a matching encryption key size to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext

	- Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication, Non-repudiation
	- **Digital Signature:** a hash digest of a message encrypted with the sender's private key to let the recipient know the document was created and sent by the person claiming to have sent it

- Algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3 
- **Hashing:** one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and produces a unique message digest as its output; another unique thing about a hash digest is that they are always the same length
	- **MD5:** creates a 128-bit hash value that is unique to the input file
		- **collision:** two files having the exact same resulting hash digest becaue the MD5 output is only 128 bits long
	- **Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) families:** each version of SHA performs a different number of rounds of mathematical computations to create the hash digest (~64-80 rounds in SHA-1 and SHA-2)
		- **SHA-1:** creates a 160-bit hash digest, which significantly reduces the number of collisions that occur
		- **SHA-2:** functions that contain longer hash digests
			- **SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-348, SHA-512**
		- **SHA-3:** newer (fundamentally different!) family of hash functions, and its hash digest can go between 224 bits and 512 bits (like SHA-2), but it uses 120 rounds of computations to provide more security
	- **RACE Integrity Primitive Evaluation Message Digest (RIPEMD):** comes in 160-bit (most common: *RIPEMD-160*), 256-bit, nd 320-bit versions	
		- **RIPEMD-160:** open-source hashing algorithm that was created as a competitor to the SHA family, but not as poopulat
	- **Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC):** used to check the integrity of a message and provide some level of assurance that its authenticity is real; *paired with other algorithms*
		- **HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1, HMAC-SHA256**
- **Digital Signature:** created by hashing a file and then taking that resulting hash digest and encrypting it with a private key; *creates non-repudiation*
	- to practically use digital signatures, we will use either DSA, RSA, or an elliptic curve cryptogtaphy version of either DSA or SHA
- **Digital Security Standard (DSS):** used by the US federal government; relies upon a 160-bit message digest created by the Digital Security Algorithm
	- most commerical entities will rely in RSA instead because it tends to be faster and multi-use
- **Code Signing:** the process of digitally signing software or code using a cryptographic certificate to verify two things: authenticity and integrity

	- **Downgrade Attacks:** aims to force a system into using a weaker or older cryptographic standard or protocl than what it's currently utilizing
		- **Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption (POODLE):** targeted SSL version 3.0
		- these downgrade attacks are dangerous because they turn the very nature of evolving security, such as the development of stronger, more robust cryptographic protocols, against itself

			- the proabability that two distinct inputs, when processed through a hashing function, will produce the same output, or a collision
	- **Quantum Computing:** a computer that uses quantu, mechanics to generate and manipulate bit (qubits) in order to access enormous processing powers
		- with quantum computing, instead of using ones and zeros, it uses quantum bit or qubits
		- **Quantum Communication:** a communication network that relies on qubits made of photons (light) to send multiple combinations of ones and zeros simultaneously which results in tamper resistant and extremely fast communications
		- **Qubit:** a quantum bit composed of electrons or photons that can represent numerous combinations of ones and zeros at the same time through superposition
		- designed for very specific use cases, such as very complex math problems or trying to do something like the modeling of an atom or some kind of atomic structure
- Cryptopgraphy is used to secure communications and data by relying on how difficult a math problem is to compute with traditional computers, that's what gives the strength in cryptography
	- we rely heavily on key exchange using asymmetric communication, which can be much weaker against quantum computing
- **Post-quantum Cryptography:** a new kind of cryptographic algorithm that can be implemented using today's classical computers but is also impervious to attacks from future quantum computers
