## Module 22.5: Analyzing Vulnerabilities  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain vulnerability analysis methods  
- Recognize prioritization needs  

**Key Topics:**  
- Consider severity, exploitability, and asset value  
- Use CVSS scoring as a framework  
- Focus resources on high-risk vulnerabilities first  
- confirmation, prioritization, classification, organizational impact, exposure factor, risk tolerance
- **Confirmation**
	- true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative
- **Prioritization:** rank vulnerabilities by severity and impact on the organization
	- the ease of exploitation, the magnitude of the potential damage, the importance of the affected system
	- the type of threat, the potential impact on the organization, the systems or data that may be affected
		- software flaaws, configuration errors, security policy gaps
		- buffer overflows, privilege escalation, insecure default settings
- **Classification**	
	- **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE):** system that provides a standardized way to uniquely identify and reference knowwn vulnerabilities in software and hardware
		- cve.mitre.org
		- CVEs help assess security and prioritize vulnerability fixes
- **Organizational Impact:** vulnerability impact assessed in terms of: confidentiality, integrity, availability
	- **Healthcare Vulnerabilities:** risk patient data and safety
	- **Financial Institution Vulnerabilities:** lead to monetary losses and regulatory scrutiny
- **Exposure Factor (EF):**  used as a quantifiable metric to help a sybersecurity professional understand the exact percentage of an asset that is likely to be damaged or affected if a particular vulnerability is exploiited
	- organizations must grasp exposure factors for effective qualitative risk management
		- to properly allocate time, money, resources
- **Risk Tolerance:** refers to the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives and before action is deemed necessary to mitiggate the risk
	- aligning vulnerability management with risk tolerance ensures security stays in line with business strategies
