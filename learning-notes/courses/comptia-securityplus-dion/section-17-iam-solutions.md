[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/)  
---

## Overview  
Section 17 focuses on Identity and Access Management (IAM), which governs how users are identified, authenticated, and authorized. Learners review IAM frameworks, multifactor authentication, password security, and common password attacks, along with defenses against them.  

---

## Module 17.1: IAM Solutions Overview  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define IAM and its importance  
- Recognize goals of IAM solutions  

**Key Topics:**  
- IAM ensures the right individuals access the right resources at the right times  
- Components: identification, authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)  
- Supports compliance, security, and operational efficiency  

---

## Module 17.2: Identity and Access Management (IAM)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain IAM principles  
- Recognize common IAM technologies  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Identification:** claiming an identity (e.g., username)  
- **Authentication:** verifying identity (passwords, MFA, biometrics)  
- **Authorization:** granting appropriate permissions  
- **Accounting:** auditing access and usage  
- Tools: SSO, federation, directory services (LDAP, Active Directory)  

---

## Module 17.3: Multifactor Authentication (MFA)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define MFA and its categories  
- Recognize the strength of layered authentication  

**Key Topics:**  
- MFA requires two or more factors:  
  - Something you know (password, PIN)  
  - Something you have (token, smart card, phone)  
  - Something you are (biometrics)  
- Increases resilience against credential theft  
- Common in VPNs, cloud logins, and banking systems  

---

## Module 17.4: Password Security  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain best practices for password security  
- Recognize policies that strengthen authentication  

**Key Topics:**  
- Enforce strong password complexity and length  
- Encourage passphrases over short, complex strings  
- Regular password changes balanced with usability  
- Storage: hash + salt to protect credentials in databases  

---

## Module 17.5: Password Attacks  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify common password attack types  
- Explain defenses against them  

**Key Topics:**  
- Attacks: brute force, dictionary, rainbow table, credential stuffing, spraying  
- Defenses: account lockouts, MFA, password complexity, salting and hashing  
- Monitoring for compromised credentials in breaches  

---

## Completion Status  
- All Section 17 materials reviewed  
- Flashcards created for IAM concepts, MFA categories, password best practices, and attack defenses
