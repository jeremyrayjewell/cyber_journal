- **XSRF/CSRF:** tricks authenticated users into executing unwanted actions  
- Defenses: input/output validation, CSRF tokens, same-site cookies  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** injects a malicious script into a trusted site to compromise the site's visitors
	- attacker identifies an input validation vulnerability within a trusted website
	- attacker crafts a URL to perform code injection against the trusted website
	- the trusted siite returns a page containing the malicious code injected
	- malicious code runs in the client's browser with permission level as the trusted site
		- defacing the trusted website
		- stealing the user's data
		- intercepting the data or communications
		- installing malware on client's system
- **XSS** breaks the browsers security and trust model
	- `https://www.diontraining.com/search?q=<script%20type='application/javascript'> alert ('xss')</script>`
	- **Non-Persistent XSS:** this type of attack only occurs when it's launched and happens once
	- **Persistent XSS:** allows an attacker to insert code into the backend database used by that trusted website
	- **Document Object Model (DOM) XSS:** exploits the client's web browser using client-side scripts to modify the content and layout of the web page
		- `https://diontraining.com/index.html# default<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
		- document.write, document.location
- **Session Management:** enables web applications to uniquely identify a user across several different actions and requests
- **Cookie:** text file used to store information about a user when they visit a website
	- **Non-Persistent:** known as a session cookie, which resides in memory and is used for a very short period of time
	- **Persistent:** stored in the browser cache until either deleted by a user or expired
- **Session Hijacking:** type of spoofing attack where the attacker diconnects a host and then replaces it with his or her own machine by spoofing the original host IP
	- session tokens need to be generated using a non-predictable algoritm
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF):** malicious script is used to exploit a session started on another site within the same web browser
	- how to prevent cross-site request forgery:
		- use user-specific tokens in all form submissinos
		- add randomness and prompt for additional information
		- require users to enter their current password when changing their password

	- Buffer overflow attacks in IT are being used as the initial vector, causing 85% of data breaches
	- there is a sequence of memory buffers after Buffer A in the contact list application
- **Stack:** a memory region where a program stores the return addresses from function calls
	- **"Smashing the Stack":** occurs when an attacker can execute their malicious code by overwriting the return address
- **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):** a security measure that randomizes memory addresses, making buffer overflow attacks harder for attackers

- **Race Condition:** software vulnerability where the outcome depends on the timing of events not matching the developer's intended order
	- race conditions occur when multiple threads write to the same variable or object in the same memory location simultaneously
- **Dereferencing:** software vulnerability that occurs when the code attempts to remove the relationship between a pointer and the thing that pointer was pointing to in the memory
- **Dirty Cow:** popular 2016 exploit, showcasing a race condition exploitation
	- **COW:** Copy On Write
- **Time-of-Check (TOC):** type of race condition where an attacker can alter a system resource after an application checks its state but before the operation is performed
- **Time-of-Use (TOU):** type of race condition that occurs when an attacker can change the state of a system resource between the time it is checked and the time it is used
- **Time-of-Evaluation (TOE):** type of race condition that involves the manipulation of data or resources during the time window when a system is making a decision or evaluations
- *to protect against a race condition, users can use locks and mutexes to lock resources while a process is being run*
- **Mutex:** mutually exclussive flag that acts as a gatekeeper to a section of code so that onl one thread an be processed at a time
_ **Deadlock:** occurs when a lock remains in place because the process it's waiting for is terminated crashes, or doesn't finish properly, despite the processing being complete
