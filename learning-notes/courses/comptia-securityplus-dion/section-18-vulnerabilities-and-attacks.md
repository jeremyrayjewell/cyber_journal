	- end-of-life hardware
	- legacy hardware
	- unsupported systems and applications
	- unpatched systems
	- hardware misconfigurations
 - kind of hardware:
	- servers
	- workstations
	- laptops
	- swtiches
	- routers
	- network appliances
	- mobile devices
	- IoT devices
- **Firmware:** specialized form of software stored on hardware device, like a router or a smart thermostat, that provides low-level control for the device's specific hardware
	- vulnerabilities: without security, outdated security
	- mitigation: regular updates, security audits, device hardening
- **End-of-Life Systems:** hardware or software products that have reached the end of their life cycle
- **Legacy Systems:** outdated computing software, hardware, or technologies that have been largely superseded by newer and more efficient alternatives
- **Unsupported Systems:** hardware or software products that no longer receive official technical support, security updates, or patches from their respective vendors or developers
- **Unpatched System:** device, application, or piece of software that has not been updated with the latest security patches so that it remains vulnerable to known exploits and attacks
	- unauthorized access, data compromise, service disruption
	- regularly monitoring for updates, assessing the relevance and impact of patches, deploying patches in a timely manner
- **Hardware Misconfiguration:** occurs when a device's settings, parameters, or options are not optimally set up, and this can cause vulnerabilities to exist, a decrease in performance or unintended behavior of devices or systems
	- conduct regular audits, enforce good configuration management practices, implement automated tools, provide training to the personnel
- *hardening:* involves tightening the security of a system
- *patching:* involves the regular updating of the software, formware, and applications with the latest security patches
- *configuration enforcement:* used to ensure that all devices and systems adhere to a standard secure configuration
- *decommissioning:* means that the system is retired and removed from the network
- *isolation:* used to limit the potential damage that might occur from a potential security breach
- *segmentation:* used to divide the network into segments

## Module 18.3: Bluetooth Vulnerabilities and Attacks  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain Bluetooth vulnerabilities  
- Recognize attack types  

**Key Topics:**  
- Exploits: Bluejacking (spam), Bluesnarfing (data theft), Bluebugging (device control)  
- Risks from insecure pairing and weak encryption  
- Mitigation: disable unused Bluetooth, update devices, enforce policies  
- **Bluetooth:** wireless technology standard used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances without the need for an Internet connection
	- **Insecure Device Pairing:** occurs when Bluetooth devices establish a connection without proper authentication
	- **Device Spoofing:** occurs when an attacker impersonates a device to trick a user into connecting
	- **On-Path Attack:** exploits Bluetooth protocol vulnerabilities to intercept and alter communications between devices without either party being aware
- Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing, Bluebugging, Bluesmack, Blueborne
- make calls, send text messages, access the internet
- best practicies:
	- turning off Bluetooth
	- ensuring that devices are set to "non-discoverable" mode
	- regularly updating devices
	- only pairing with known and trusted devices
	- always using unique PINs or passkeys
	- always being cautious of unsolicited connection requests
	- using encryption for sensitive data transfers
