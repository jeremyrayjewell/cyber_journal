---

## Overview  
Section 20 covers hardening practices that strengthen systems, networks, and applications against attacks. Learners study configuration management, application restrictions, service reduction, patching, group policies, SELinux, encryption, and secure baselines. The focus is on eliminating unnecessary risk exposure while maintaining system functionality.

---

## Module 20.4: Unnecessary Services  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain risks of unnecessary services  
- Recognize examples  

**Key Topics:**  
- Unneeded services increase attack surface

- Regular audits identify unnecessary processes  

---

## Module 20.5: Trusted Operating Systems  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define trusted operating systems  
- Recognize their role in secure environments  

**Key Topics:**  
- Designed with security controls built-in (e.g., security certifications, hardened kernels)  
- Support access control, auditing, secure policies  
- Used in military, government, and critical systems  

---

## Module 20.6: Updates and Patches  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain role of updates and patches  
- Recognize patch management needs  

**Key Topics:**  
- Regular patching reduces vulnerabilities  
- Must test before deployment to avoid disruptions  
- Includes OS, applications, firmware  

---

## Module 20.7: Patch Management  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define patch management processes  
- Recognize best practices  

**Key Topics:**  
- Centralized management via patch servers or tools  
- Includes inventorying, testing, deploying, and auditing patches  
- Critical to mitigate zero-day and known exploits  

---

## Module 20.8: Group Policies  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain role of group policies in hardening  
- Recognize common controls  

**Key Topics:**  
- Centralized enforcement of security configurations  
- Examples: password policies, screen locks, software restrictions  
- Supports consistency across environments  

---

## Module 20.9: SELinux  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)  
- Recognize its capabilities  

**Key Topics:**  
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC) framework for Linux  
- Restricts processes and users beyond discretionary access controls  
- Provides fine-grained security enforcement  

---

## Module 20.10: Data Encryption Levels  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain different encryption levels  
- Recognize their applications  

**Key Topics:**  
- Encryption at rest, in transit, and in use  
- Protects confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data  
- Must align with compliance and business needs  

---

## Module 20.11: Secure Baselines  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define secure baselines  
- Explain their role in hardening  

**Key Topics:**  
- Documented standard configurations for systems/devices  
- Serve as reference for compliance and audits  
- Baseline drift must be monitored and corrected  

---
