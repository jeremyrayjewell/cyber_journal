---

## Overview  
Section 23 covers the tools and practices for alerting and monitoring in cybersecurity operations. Learners examine SNMP, SIEM platforms, SCAP, NetFlow, and monitoring resources to detect threats, generate alerts, and provide visibility into security events.  

---

## Module 23.1: Alerting and Monitoring Overview  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define alerting and monitoring in cybersecurity  
- Recognize their roles in defense  

**Key Topics:**  
- Monitoring provides visibility into systems, networks, and users  
- Alerting notifies security teams of suspicious or abnormal activity  
- Together, form the foundation of detection and response  

---

## Module 23.2: Monitoring Resources  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain what resources should be monitored  
- Recognize monitoring goals  

**Key Topics:**  
- Systems: servers, endpoints, applications, databases  
- Networks: firewalls, routers, switches, wireless APs  
- Users: logins, behavior, access patterns  
- Goals: detect intrusions, identify misconfigurations, ensure compliance  

---

## Module 23.3: Alerting and Monitoring Activities  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize types of monitoring activities  
- Explain alerting considerations  

**Key Topics:**  
- Continuous vs. periodic monitoring  
- Real-time alerting vs. batch reporting  
- Reducing false positives through tuning and baselines  
- Alerts prioritized by severity and impact  

---

## Module 23.4: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define SNMP and its role  
- Recognize its security considerations  

**Key Topics:**  
- SNMP monitors and manages network devices  
- Versions: SNMPv1/v2c (insecure), SNMPv3 (secure, supports encryption and authentication)  
- Useful for device health, status, and alerts  

---

## Module 23.5: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain SIEM systems and their capabilities  
- Recognize use cases  

**Key Topics:**  
- Collect and correlate logs from across the environment  
- Provide dashboards, alerts, and forensic data  
- Support compliance reporting and incident detection  
- Examples: Splunk, QRadar, Elastic, LogRhythm  

---

## Module 23.6: Data from Security Tools  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize data sources for monitoring  
- Explain integration needs  

**Key Topics:**  
- Sources: IDS/IPS, firewalls, endpoint tools, vulnerability scanners  
- Logs, telemetry, metrics aggregated into SIEM or monitoring systems  
- Correlation improves detection accuracy  

---

## Module 23.7: Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define SCAP and its benefits  
- Recognize its use in monitoring  

**Key Topics:**  
- Framework for automating vulnerability management and compliance checks  
- Standardizes vulnerability definitions (CVE, CVSS, OVAL)  
- Ensures consistency across security tools  

---

## Module 23.8: NetFlow and Flow Analysis  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define NetFlow/flow analysis  
- Recognize its role in security  

**Key Topics:**  
- Provides metadata on network traffic flows (who talks to whom, how much, when)  
- Detects anomalies, exfiltration, DDoS patterns  
- Complements packet capture with high-level visibility  

---

## Module 23.9: Single Pane of Glass  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define “single pane of glass” monitoring  
- Recognize its advantages  

**Key Topics:**  
- Unified dashboards aggregating multiple security and monitoring tools  
- Provides centralized visibility and faster decision-making  
- Reduces alert fatigue by consolidating events  

---

## Completion Status  
- All Section 23 materials reviewed  
- Flashcards created for SNMP versions, SIEM capabilities, SCAP standards, and NetFlow use cases
