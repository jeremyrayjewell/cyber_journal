---

## Overview  
Section 14 focuses on ensuring continuity of operations through resilience and redundancy. Learners study high availability, data redundancy, RAID, capacity planning, backup strategies, redundant sites, and resilience testing. Emphasis is placed on planning, preparation, and infrastructure support to ensure critical services remain available during disruptions.

---

## Module 14.4: Configuring RAID  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify RAID levels and their purposes  
- Explain advantages and trade-offs  

**Key Topics:**  
- RAID 0: striping, performance, no redundancy  
- RAID 1: mirroring, high redundancy  
- RAID 5: striping with parity, balance of performance and protection  
- RAID 10: nested, combining mirroring and striping  

---

## Module 14.5: Capacity Planning  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the importance of capacity planning  
- Recognize factors that influence planning  

**Key Topics:**

- Physical design for resilience  

---

## Module 14.7: Data Backups  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain backup strategies  
- Recognize differences in methods and frequency  

**Key Topics:**  
- Types: full, differential, incremental  
- Storage options: onsite, offsite, cloud  
- Backup frequency determined by RPO (Recovery Point Objective)  
- Testing backups critical to ensure usability  

---

## Module 14.8: Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define COOP and its purpose  
- Recognize its key elements  

**Key Topics:**  
- Planning to continue mission-essential functions  
- Includes communications, alternate sites, and succession planning  
- Supports recovery time objectives (RTOs) and RPOs  

---

## Module 14.9: Redundant Site Considerations  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain different types of redundant sites  
- Recognize trade-offs of each  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Hot site:** fully operational, fastest recovery, highest cost  
- **Warm site:** partially equipped, moderate recovery and cost  
- **Cold site:** basic space, slowest recovery, lowest cost  

---

## Module 14.10: Resilience and Recovery Testing  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the importance of testing resilience measures  
- Recognize testing approaches  

**Key Topics:**  
- Regular testing ensures reliability of backups, failovers, COOP  
- Types: tabletop exercises, simulation, full-scale drills  
- Identifies gaps and validates procedures  

---
