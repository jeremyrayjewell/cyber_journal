- Pay attention to emphasized text (bold, italics, ALL CAPS)  
- Select answers that are correct across the **widest range of scenarios**  
- Performance-based questions test conceptual understanding, not rote memorization 
- Answer based on **CompTIA Security+** knowledge, not personal/workplace experience
- 99% of the time you just need to know the tool and what it is used for, **NOT** specific syntax, etc.... **we must recognize, not regurgitate**
