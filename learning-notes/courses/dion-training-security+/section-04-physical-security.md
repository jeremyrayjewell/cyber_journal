# CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) Complete Course & Practice Exam  
## Section 4 â€“ Physical Security  

[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/)  
---

## Overview  
Section 4 examines physical security measures used to deter, delay, and prevent unauthorized access to facilities. Learners study controls such as fencing, bollards, locks, vestibules, and surveillance systems, as well as methods attackers use to bypass them, including brute force entry and access badge cloning.  

---

## Module 4.1: Physical Security Basics  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define physical security and its role in cybersecurity  
- Identify categories of physical controls  

**Key Topics:**  
- Physical security protects people, facilities, and information  
- Examples: locks, fencing, bollards, access badges, guards, lighting, sensors  
- Complements technical and administrative controls

---

## Module 4.2: Fencing and Bollards  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the purpose of fencing and bollards  
- Identify situations where each is appropriate  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Fencing:** defines boundaries, deters casual intruders, delays attackers  
- **Bollards:** prevent vehicle-based attacks or forced entry  
- Often used together with surveillance and patrols

---

## Module 4.3: Access Control Vestibules  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Describe how vestibules (mantraps) support access control  
- Recognize how they reduce tailgating and piggybacking  

**Key Topics:**  
- Two sets of interlocked doors controlling entry  
- Authentication required at each stage  
- May integrate biometrics or badge readers

---

## Module 4.4: Door Locks  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Compare lock types and their vulnerabilities  
- Understand use cases for mechanical vs. electronic locks  

**Key Topics:**  
- Types: mechanical deadbolts, electronic locks, biometric locks  
- Weaknesses: picking, brute force, or poor installation  
- Security strengthened when combined with logging or MFA

---

## Module 4.5: Surveillance Systems  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the role of surveillance in security monitoring  
- Recognize limitations and bypasses  

**Key Topics:**  
- Systems: CCTV, IP cameras, DVR/NVR  
- Sensors: infrared, ultrasonic, microwave, pressure-based  
- Weaknesses: blind spots, tampering, poor resolution  
- Countermeasures: redundancy, proper placement

---

## Module 4.6: Attacks on Physical Controls  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify methods used to bypass physical defenses  
- Understand risks from cloned badges and forced entry  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Brute force:** physically breaking locks or barriers  
- **Badge cloning:** duplicating access cards to bypass authentication  
- **Surveillance evasion:** exploiting blind spots, disabling systems  
- Mitigation: stronger locks, multifactor authentication, redundant surveillance, guards 

---

## Completion Status  
- All Section 4 materials reviewed  
- Flashcards created for physical controls and bypass techniques
