- Often cloud-integrated with advanced analytics  

---

## Module 21.9: User Behavior Analytics (UBA)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain UBA concepts  
- Recognize its benefits  

**Key Topics:**  
- Uses machine learning to detect abnormal activity  
- Identifies insider threats, compromised accounts, and anomalies  
- Complements SIEM and EDR for holistic monitoring  

---

## Module 21.10: Selecting Secure Protocols  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize secure protocol choices  
- Explain their application  

**Key Topics:**
