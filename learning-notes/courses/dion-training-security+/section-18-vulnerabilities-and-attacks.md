---

## Module 18.5: Zero-day Vulnerabilities  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define zero-day vulnerabilities  
- Recognize their impact  

**Key Topics:**  
- Exploits unknown to vendor and unpatched  
- Highly valuable to attackers  
- Defenses: patch management, threat intelligence, layered defenses  

---

## Module 18.6: Operating System Vulnerabilities  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify OS vulnerabilities  
- Recognize related attack methods  

**Key Topics:**  
- Outdated patches, misconfigurations, privilege escalation  
- Kernel exploits, insecure services  
- Mitigation: patching, secure baselines, least privilege  

---

## Module 18.7: SQL and XML Injections  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain injection attacks  
- Recognize their risks  

**Key Topics:**  
- SQL injection: manipulating queries to extract/modify data  
- XML injection: altering XML structures to manipulate logic  
- Defenses: parameterized queries, input validation, sanitization  

---

## Module 18.8: Conducting an SQL Injection  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand mechanics of SQL injection  
- Recognize exploitation steps  

**Key Topics:**  
- Entering malicious SQL into input fields  
- Bypassing authentication, extracting data, escalating privileges  
- Importance of secure coding and input handling  

---

## Module 18.9: XSS and XSRF  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (XSRF/CSRF)  
- Recognize their impacts  

**Key Topics:**  
- **XSS:** injects malicious scripts into web apps (stored, reflected, DOM-based)  
- **XSRF/CSRF:** tricks authenticated users into executing unwanted actions  
- Defenses: input/output validation, CSRF tokens, same-site cookies  

---

## Module 18.10: Buffer Overflow  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain buffer overflow vulnerabilities  
- Recognize risks  

**Key Topics:**  
- Occurs when data exceeds allocated memory buffer  
- Can overwrite adjacent memory, execute arbitrary code  
- Defenses: input validation, safe coding, DEP/ASLR protections  

---

## Module 18.11: Race Conditions  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define race conditions  
- Recognize their risks  

**Key Topics:**  
- Occur when processes depend on timing or order of operations  
- Exploited to gain elevated privileges or bypass checks  
- Mitigation: synchronization, secure coding, testing  

---
