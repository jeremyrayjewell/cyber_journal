[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/securityplus/)  
---

## Overview  
Section 2 introduces the foundational principles of security. Learners study the interplay between threats, vulnerabilities, and risk, the CIA triad, non-repudiation, AAA, and the categories and types of security controls. The section also explains how to conduct a gap analysis and explores the concepts behind Zero Trust architectures.

## Module 2.1: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risk  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define and distinguish between threats, vulnerabilities, and risks  
- Explain the role of risk management  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Threats:** natural disasters, cyber-attacks, disclosure of information, data integrity breaches  
- **Vulnerabilities:** software flaws, misconfigurations, missing patches, weak physical security  
- **Risk:** intersection of threats and vulnerabilities  
	Threat + No Vulnerability = No Risk
	Vulnerability + No Threat = No Risk
- **Risk management:** reducing likelihood and impact through controls

**Notes:**
- Remember **end user risk** - they will try to bypass for convenience
- **Security posture** must be loosened or strengthened to balance end user risk
- **Information security** (data) vs **information systems security** (devices)

## Module 2.2: The CIA(NA) Triad(Pentagon)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Summarize confidentiality, integrity, and availability  
- Apply methods to preserve each principle  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Confidentiality:** encryption, access controls, data masking, physical security measures, training and awareness 
	- to protect personal privacy
	- to maintain a business advantage
	- to achieve regulatory compliance
- **Integrity:** hashing (#1 method), digital signatures, checksums, access controls, regular audits  
	- to ensure data accuracy
	- to maintain trust
	- to ensure system operability
- **Availability:** redundancy of servers (#1 method), data, networks, power sources
	- 2 nines: 99%... 3.5 days of downtime per year
	- 3 nines: 99.9%... 8,760 hours are available and can only be down for a maximum of 8.76 hours
	- 5 nines: 99.999%... system guarantees a downtime of no more than 5.26 minutes in a year
	- ensuring business continuity
	- maintianing customer trust
	- upholding an organization's reputation
	- redundancies: server, data, network, power
- **Non-repudiation** 
- **Authentication**

## Module 2.3: Non-repudiation and AAA  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define non-repudiation in communications (action/event cannot be denied by the parties involved)  
- Explain authentication, authorization, and accounting  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Non-repudiation:** ensures actions cannot be denied (e.g., digital signatures)  
- **Authentication:** verifying identity (passwords, biometrics, MFA)  
- **Authorization:** permissions granted after authentication  
- **Accounting:** logs, audit trails, SIEM for tracking use of resources

## Module 2.4: Security Control Categories and Types  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify security control categories  
- Recognize different control types  

**Key Topics:**  
- **Categories:**  
  - Technical (firewalls, encryption, IDS/IPS)  
  - Managerial (policies, risk assessments, governance)  
  - Operational (incident response, change management)  
  - Physical (locks, guards, surveillance)  
- **Types:** preventive, deterrent, detective, corrective, compensating, directive 

---

## Module 2.5: Gap Analysis  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain how a gap analysis identifies weaknesses  
- Use analysis to compare current vs. desired state  

**Key Topics:**  
- Steps: define scope, gather data, compare to objectives, plan remediation  
- Variants: technical vs. business gap analysis  
- Tool: Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M) 

---

## Module 2.6: Zero Trust Architecture  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand Zero Trust principles  
- Differentiate between control plane and data plane functions  

**Key Topics:**  
- Principle: “Never trust, always verify”  
- **Control Plane:** adaptive identity, policy-driven access, secured zones  
- **Data Plane:** enforcement through policy engine, administrator, enforcement points 

---

## Completion Status  
- All Section 2 materials reviewed  
- Flashcards created for CIA triad, AAA, control categories/types, gap analysis, and Zero Trust
