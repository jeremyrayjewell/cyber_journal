## Overview  
Section 16 covers security infrastructure technologies, protocols, and controls used to protect modern networks. Learners examine firewalls, IDS/IPS, network appliances, port security, secure communications, SD-WAN/SASE, and considerations for selecting infrastructure controls.  

---

## Module 16.1: Security Infrastructure Overview  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define security infrastructure and its purpose  
- Recognize key categories of infrastructure controls  

**Key Topics:**  
- Combines hardware, software, and processes for defense-in-depth  
- Controls include preventive, detective, corrective, and compensating measures  
- Infrastructure must support confidentiality, integrity, and availability  

---

## Module 16.2: Ports and Protocols  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain common ports and protocols  
- Recognize their security implications  

**Key Topics:**  
- Well-known ports: 20/21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 25 (SMTP), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)  
- Secure alternatives: SFTP, SMTPS, HTTPS  
- Protocol misuse can expose networks to threats  

---

## Module 16.3: Firewalls  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define firewalls and their role  
- Recognize firewall types  

**Key Topics:**  
- Packet-filtering, stateful inspection, next-generation firewalls (NGFWs)  
- Block/allow traffic based on rules  
- Essential for network segmentation and perimeter defense  

---

## Module 16.4: Configuring Firewalls  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain firewall configuration principles  
- Recognize best practices  

**Key Topics:**  
- Principle of least privilege for rule creation  
- Allowlisting vs. blocklisting approaches  
- Logging, monitoring, and regular review of firewall rules  

---

## Module 16.5: IDS and IPS  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Compare Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)  
- Recognize deployment considerations  

**Key Topics:**  
- **IDS:** monitors and alerts on suspicious traffic (passive)  
- **IPS:** actively blocks malicious traffic (inline)  
- Both rely on signatures, heuristics, and anomaly detection  

---

## Module 16.6: Network Appliances  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify specialized network appliances  
- Explain their role in security  

**Key Topics:**  
- Load balancers, proxies, VPN concentrators, DLP appliances, UTMs  
- Provide additional layers of control and visibility  
- Require configuration, updates, and monitoring  

---

## Module 16.7: Port Security  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define port security measures  
- Recognize techniques to secure switch ports  

**Key Topics:**  
- Disable unused ports, MAC filtering, port-based authentication (802.1X)  
- Protects against unauthorized devices and rogue access  
- Supports defense-in-depth at access layer  

---

## Module 16.8: Securing Network Communications  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain methods of securing communications  
- Recognize encryption and tunneling protocols  

**Key Topics:**  
- VPNs with IPSec or SSL/TLS  
- Secure protocols: HTTPS, SSH, SFTP  
- Segmentation and tunneling for confidentiality and integrity  

---

## Module 16.9: SD-WAN and SASE  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define SD-WAN and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)  
- Recognize benefits for distributed organizations  

**Key Topics:**  
- **SD-WAN:** software-based WAN management, improves performance and flexibility  
- **SASE:** integrates networking and security functions (SWG, CASB, ZTNA)  
- Supports cloud adoption and secure remote access  

---

## Module 16.10: Infrastructure Considerations  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize planning considerations for infrastructure design  
- Explain trade-offs  

**Key Topics:**  
- Performance, scalability, security, and cost must be balanced  
- Redundancy, monitoring, and manageability influence design  
- Business goals shape infrastructure choices  

---

## Module 16.11: Selecting Infrastructure Controls  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain how to choose infrastructure controls  
- Recognize alignment with risk management  

**Key Topics:**  
- Controls should address identified risks and compliance obligations  
- Defense-in-depth: multiple overlapping controls for resilience  
- Selection based on effectiveness, feasibility, and cost-benefit analysis  

---

## Completion Status  
- All Section 16 materials reviewed  
- Flashcards created for firewalls, IDS/IPS, SD-WAN/SASE, and infrastructure control selection
