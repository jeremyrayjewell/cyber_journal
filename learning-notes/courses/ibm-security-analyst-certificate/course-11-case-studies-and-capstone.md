[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-case-studies-capstone-project/home/module/1)  
---

## Overview  
Course 11 is the capstone of the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Certificate. It integrates skills from all prior courses — threat analysis, penetration testing, incident response, digital forensics, and compliance — into applied case studies. Learners examine real-world breaches such as phishing, PoS attacks, ransomware, AI-related threats, and insider breaches. Each module applies structured case study analysis: identifying root causes, actions taken, evaluating effectiveness, highlighting successes and failures, analyzing impacts, and extracting lessons learned. The final project requires learners to research and analyze a real-world data breach, documenting findings in a structured report to demonstrate mastery of breach response.

## Module 1: Case Study Layouts & Phishing Case Studies  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the purpose and benefits of case study analysis  
- Apply structured frameworks for root cause and lessons-learned analysis  
- Identify phishing scam tactics and prevention strategies  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Case Study Analysis Framework:** Read scenario → Identify root cause → Document actions → Evaluate timeliness/effectiveness → Identify successes, gaps, failures → Analyze organizational impact → Summarize lessons learned → Recommend future actions:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- **Benefits of Case Studies:** Improve critical thinking, recognize patterns, design policies, train employees effectively (Ponemon study: +54% effectiveness when using real-life stories).  
- **Phishing Types:** Spear phishing, whaling, vishing, smishing, pharming.  
- **Case Study: Google & Facebook (2013–2015):** Evaldas Rimasauskas created a fake company mimicking Quanta Computer; forged invoices stole $100M+. Root cause: lack of invoice verification and employee training. Actions: delayed detection (2 years), eventual law enforcement collaboration; Impact: $50M unrecovered losses. Lessons: verification controls, phishing awareness, and advanced detection tools:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- **Case Study: Vishing – South Korean Doctor (2022):** Threat actor impersonated prosecutor’s office using social engineering, voice modulation, forged documents, and pressured victim to transfer $3M in assets. Highlights: urgency + authority = compliance. Lessons: implement strict verification processes, MFA for transactions, employee training, caller ID verification.

## Module 2: PoS and Insider Breach Case Studies  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Analyze PoS breaches and malware techniques  
- Evaluate insider breach motivations and impacts  
- Apply Kill Chain analysis to real-world breaches  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **POS Malware & Skimming:** RAM-scraping malware captures unencrypted data; skimmers gather card/PIN data covertly. Prevention: PCI DSS compliance, monitoring terminals, anti-malware, network segmentation.  
- **Case Study: Target (2013):**  
  - Attack: Vendor phishing → credential theft → RAM-scraping malware on POS → exfiltration of 40M credit cards + 70M customer records.  
  - Kill Chain phases: Reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, C2, exfiltration.  
  - Failures: Weak vendor oversight, no MFA, ignored IDS alerts.  
  - Impact: Massive financial/legal/reputation costs.  
  - Lessons: Vendor security, proactive IDS use, segmentation:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- **Case Study: Home Depot (2014):**  
  - Attack: Stolen vendor creds → zero-day Windows exploit → memory-scraping malware on 7,500 PoS terminals → 56M credit/debit cards stolen.  
  - Failures: Outdated Windows XP, poor PoS segregation, weak vendor controls, misconfigured endpoint protection.  
  - Impact: $179M+ in costs, reputation damage.  
  - Lessons: Patch management, PoS network isolation, vendor least privilege.  
- **Insider Breaches:**  
  - Types: Malicious (espionage, sabotage, theft), unintentional (negligence, accidents).  
  - Case Example: Healthcare admin sells PHI on dark web.  
  - Lessons: Insider Threat Programs, monitoring, employee well-being, and cultural vigilance.

## Module 3: AI-Related Breaches and Ransomware  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Assess AI’s role in modern breach scenarios  
- Analyze ransomware impacts and defenses  
- Apply case studies to evaluate organizational resilience  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **AI Breaches:** Attacks leveraging AI for deepfakes, automated phishing, or exploiting ML systems. Challenges: attribution, adversarial ML, poisoned training data.  
- **Ransomware:** Encrypts data, extorts payment; prevention = backups, patching, segmentation, EDR/XDR monitoring.  
- **Case Studies:** Examined real-world ransomware and AI-related breaches (details in labs).

## Module 4: Incident Response and Digital Forensics Case Studies  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Evaluate real-world IR/DFIR practices  
- Apply frameworks (NIST, SANS) in breach analysis  
- Assess digital evidence handling and lessons  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- Case studies of breaches requiring rapid IR and forensic collection.  
- Application of forensic techniques (imaging, chain of custody, log analysis).  
- Lessons: timely response, adequate tooling, law enforcement collaboration.  

---

## Module 5: Penetration Testing and Compliance Case Studies  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Review pen test methodologies applied in breach contexts  
- Examine compliance failures and successes  
- Extract lessons from case studies for organizational policy  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- Penetration testing used to simulate and analyze organizational weaknesses.  
- Compliance failures (PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) linked to breaches.  
- Case studies highlight how compliance gaps worsened incident outcomes.  

---

## Module 6: Final Project and Wrap-Up  
**Project Tasks:**  
- Research and analyze a real-world data breach of choice  
- Apply structured case study framework (root cause, actions, effectiveness, impact, lessons, recommendations)  
- Document findings in professional breach analysis report  
- Demonstrate mastery of penetration testing, IR/DFIR, compliance, and policy analysis  

**Wrap-Up:**  
- Reinforces integration of all prior IBM courses  
- Prepares learners for real-world SOC, IR, DFIR, and compliance analyst roles
