# IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate  
## Course 8 – Cybersecurity Compliance Framework & System Administration  

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-compliance-framework-standards-regulations/home/module/1)  
---

## Overview  
Course 8 focuses on governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0), IT service management through ITIL, and cybersecurity laws, standards, and audits. Learners examine compliance challenges, the consequences of non-compliance, and strategies for monitoring, automation, and change management. The course emphasizes industry frameworks (ISO, NIST, COBIT, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, OWASP), auditing processes, and asset management. The final project requires learners to analyze real-world scenarios, recommend compliance measures, and strengthen an organization’s cybersecurity posture through risk management and framework alignment.

## Module 1: Introduction to Information Security and Compliance  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain GRC and its components (governance, risk management, compliance)  
- Apply policies, standards, and procedures for IT governance  
- Describe NIST CSF 2.0 functions and tier levels  
- Assess compliance requirements and consequences of non-compliance  
- Identify benefits of automation, orchestration, change management, and asset management  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Governance:** Establishes policies, procedures, AUPs, security policies, business continuity and disaster recovery plans, and incident response plans:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- **Risk Management:** Identifies financial, operational, and cybersecurity threats; employs controls to minimize impact.  
- **Compliance:** Ensures adherence to regulations, standards, and internal policies. Non-compliance results in fines, sanctions, license revocation, reputational damage, or contractual breaches.  
- **GRC Tools:** IBM OpenPages, IBM FIRST Risk Case Studies, RSA Archer Suite, MetricStream — streamline risk/compliance activities.  
- **NIST CSF 2.0:** Six components — Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. Four tiers — Tier 1: Partial, Tier 2: Risk-Informed, Tier 3: Repeatable, Tier 4: Adaptive. Case study: Community Bank applied CSF to protect customer data and restore services after attacks:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Due diligence, attestation, internal/external audits, automation (patching, scanning).  
- **Standardization:** Uniform network configs, access control (SSO, MFA), patch management, incident response, and training.  
- **Automation/Orchestration:** Automates provisioning, RBAC, escalation, scaling, ticketing; orchestration coordinates across systems. Benefits: faster reaction, workforce multiplier, baseline enforcement, employee retention.  
- **Change Management:** Structured process with approvals, stakeholder input, testing, rollback plans, documentation, and version control. Risks: downtime, dependency failures, blocked services, legacy system issues.  
- **Asset Management:** Procurement, monitoring, and disposal/decommissioning with secure data destruction (shredding, degaussing, incineration, EMP).

## Module 2: Foundations of IT Service Management and Risk Governance  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define ITIL and ITSM and explain their relevance to cybersecurity  
- Describe CMDB (Configuration Management Database) and its benefits  
- Apply ITIL lifecycle stages (strategy, design, transition, operation, continual improvement)  
- Conduct risk analysis and third-party/vendor risk management  
- Evaluate ethical implications of AI in cybersecurity  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **ITIL:** Originated in UK 1980s; ensures IT services align with business needs.  
- **CMDB:** Central hub of configuration items (servers, software, service agreements, dependencies). Enables incident/change management, asset tracking, compliance.  
- **ITIL Lifecycle:**  
  - Service Strategy → defines markets, financial planning, resource/risk management.  
  - Service Design → SLAs, capacity/availability management, continuity planning.  
  - Service Transition → change/release management, configuration validation.  
  - Service Operation → incident/problem management, service desk, access control.  
  - Continual Service Improvement → KPI reviews, lessons learned, feedback loops:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- **Risk Management:** Identify, analyze, mitigate risks. Third-party/vendor assessments protect supply chain integrity.  
- **AI Ethics:** Addresses bias, accountability, transparency in automated decisions.

## Module 3: Cybersecurity Laws and Regulations  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Compare U.S. and global cybersecurity laws and standards  
- Apply HIPAA, PCI DSS, GDPR, SOX, and other frameworks to real-world scenarios  
- Analyze industry-specific regulations and compliance strategies  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **US Regulations:**  
  - HIPAA (healthcare privacy/security)  
  - SOX (financial reporting integrity)  
  - PCI DSS (credit card transactions, 12 requirements)  
  - GLBA (financial data protection)  
- **Global Regulations:**  
  - GDPR (EU data protection, “right to be forgotten,” fines up to 4% global revenue)  
  - PIPEDA (Canada)  
  - China’s CSL, Brazil’s LGPD, Colombia’s Habeas Data laws  
- **Implications:** Legal, contractual, reputational, and operational consequences for non-compliance.

## Module 4: Cybersecurity Standards and Audits  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain the purpose and scope of standards (NIST, ISO, COBIT, OWASP, IEEE, ISACA)  
- Conduct and respond to security control audits  
- Interpret SOC reports and their role in cybersecurity assurance  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Industry Standards:**  
  - **NIST SP 800-series** (guidance for risk management, controls, assessment)  
  - **ISO/IEC 27001** (information security management systems)  
  - **COBIT** (governance and management of enterprise IT)  
  - **OWASP** (application security, Top 10 vulnerabilities)  
  - **IEEE, ISACA** standards for technical and governance practices:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.  
- **Audits:** Internal/external control validation; ensures alignment with laws/regulations.  
- **SOC Reports:**  
  - SOC 1 (financial reporting)  
  - SOC 2 (security, availability, confidentiality, integrity, privacy)  
  - SOC 3 (general distribution). Provide assurance to stakeholders on control effectiveness.
