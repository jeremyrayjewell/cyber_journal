## Course 13 – Generative AI: Boost Your Cybersecurity Career  

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-boost-your-cybersecurity-career/home/module/1)  
---

## Overview  
Course 13 explores how **Generative AI (GenAI)** can be applied to cybersecurity tasks. Learners examine the benefits and risks of using generative AI systems, with particular focus on **large language models (LLMs)**, **prompt injection vulnerabilities**, **content filtering**, **threat intelligence**, and **cybersecurity analytics**. The course emphasizes balancing innovation with responsibility: while GenAI enables rapid threat detection, automated playbooks, and anomaly spotting, it also introduces risks like hallucinations, adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and biased outputs. Hands-on labs demonstrate both **malicious misuse** (e.g., generating a keylogger) and **defensive applications** (e.g., AI-assisted malicious code detection, offensive content filtering). The final project consolidates all learnings.

## Module 1: Get Started with Generative AI in Cybersecurity  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Differentiate conventional AI from generative AI  
- Explain the benefits and applications of generative AI in cybersecurity  
- Recognize threats to generative AI systems and associated risks  
- Guard against NLP-based attacks (e.g., prompt injections, data leakage, inadequate sandboxing)  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Conventional vs Generative AI:**  
  - Conventional AI: rule-based, structured, fixed tasks.  
  - Generative AI: adaptive, creative, capable of novel outputs (text, images, simulations):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
- **Cybersecurity Benefits:**  
  - Automated playbook creation and continuous improvement.  
  - Reduced response time during incidents.  
  - Creativity in spotting subtle anomalies conventional AI may miss.  
- **Applications:** Threat intelligence, incident response planning, dynamic threat hunting, automated security alerts, vulnerability assessment, user behavior analytics, and policy compliance automation.  
- **Risks with LLMs:**  
  - Prompt injection (direct/indirect) and jailbreaks.  
  - Data leakage (PII or sensitive corporate data).  
  - Inadequate sandboxing (LLM given excessive system privileges).  
  - Unauthorized code execution.  
  - Biases: confirmation, selection, contextual, linguistic, anchoring, automation bias:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- **NLP-Based Attacks:** Prevent via input cleaning, blocklists, debiasing, strict sandboxing, content-aware filtering, and reinforcement learning with human feedback.  

**Hands-On Lab:** *Preventing Malicious Code Execution with Generative AI*  
- Generate a **Python keylogger** (misuse case).  
- Use GenAI to create a **detection script** that flags suspicious imports (e.g., `pynput`, `keyboard.Listener`).  
- Run detector before executing unknown scripts.  
- Extend with unauthorized file access monitoring and obfuscated code explanation.

## Module 2: SIEM and SOC Tasks Using Generative AI  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Integrate generative AI into SIEM and SOC operations  
- Apply GenAI to incident response, threat detection, and security automation  
- Evaluate ethical issues, risks, and considerations of using GenAI  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Cybersecurity Analytics Types:**  
  - *Descriptive* – past events/trends.  
  - *Diagnostic* – root cause identification.  
  - *Predictive* – forecast threats using ML.  
  - *Prescriptive* – recommend actions.  
  - *Behavioral* – detect insider/APT threats via anomalies.  
- **Platforms & Tools:** SIEM, UEBA, EDR, cloud security monitoring, IoT monitoring, vulnerability management:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.  
- **Benefits of GenAI in SOC:** Threat detection, DLP, early warning, reduced false positives, efficient IR, compliance support, continuous monitoring, cost reduction, scalability.  
- **Emerging Trends:**  
  - AI red teams for stress-testing AI-powered systems.  
  - Integration of GenAI into cyber risk platforms.  
  - Risk modeling, incident reporting, and regulatory compliance.  
- **Content Filtering & Monitoring:**  
  - Anomaly detection in traffic and user behavior.  
  - Phishing simulation and detection.  
  - Real-time policy adaptation.  
  - Insider threat detection through behavior analytics.  

**Hands-On Lab:** *Using Generative AI to Block/Remove Offensive Content*  
- Use ChatGPT to detect and filter offensive text.  
- Apply anomaly detection and dynamic policy adaptation to improve monitoring.

## Module 3: Final Project and Wrap-Up  
**Project Tasks:**  
- Consolidate knowledge of generative AI applications in cybersecurity.  
- Demonstrate use of GenAI in SIEM/SOC, content filtering, and analytics.  
- Assess security risks, mitigation strategies, and ethical issues.  
- Submit final exam and project deliverable showcasing practical applications.  

**Wrap-Up:**  
- Review glossary of GenAI and cybersecurity terms.  
- Re-emphasize responsible AI practices, transparency, and data integrity.  
- Highlight future trends: stronger AI-cybersecurity symbiosis, move from passwords to **passkeys**, countering deepfakes, and mitigating hallucinations via RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
