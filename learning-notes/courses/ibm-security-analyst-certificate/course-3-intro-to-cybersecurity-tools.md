## Course 3 – Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks  

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-cybersecurity-tools-cyber-attacks/home/module/1)  
---

## Overview  
Course 3 builds on foundational concepts by exploring the history of cybersecurity, the evolution of global security policy, and the necessity of critical thinking in combating modern cyber threats. Learners study the diverse ecosystem of threat actors, their motives, and their techniques, while analyzing case studies such as the *WarGames* movie’s influence on U.S. policy, the 9/11 attacks’ effect on global surveillance, and the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on cybersecurity practices. Technical modules cover malware, ransomware, botnets, social engineering, denial-of-service attacks, and common security controls. The course also introduces identity and access management (IAM) and the physical safeguards required for holistic defense. A final project requires students to apply knowledge to secure organizational access.

## Module 1: Cybersecurity Insights  
This module explores how key historical events shaped cybersecurity policy and practice, while introducing critical thinking as a core professional skill.  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Trace the origins of U.S. cybersecurity policy and the NSDD 145 directive  
- Summarize how 9/11 changed the role of cybersecurity in national defense  
- Describe how COVID-19 accelerated the virtual shift and associated risks  
- Define critical thinking and its role in cybersecurity decision-making  
- Apply the five elements of the critical thinking model  
- Identify five essential critical thinking skills  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **WarGames (1983)** – A fictional hacking scenario led President Reagan to request a review of national cyber defenses. The result was NSDD 145 (1984), the first U.S. cybersecurity policy, mandating threat evaluation processes, optimized resource allocation, and secure handling of classified electronic systems. It also established the NTISSC to guide policy.  
- **9/11 Attacks (2001)** – Terrorists exploited the internet for encrypted communication, planning, and recruitment. The aftermath saw hacktivist attacks, website defacements, and phishing scams tied to 9/11. U.S. responses included creating the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the National Cyber Security Division (NCSD), and passing the USA PATRIOT Act. Later reforms, like the USA Freedom Act (2015), sought to balance surveillance with civil liberties.  
- **COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)** – Remote work expanded the attack surface. BYOD policies and weak home Wi-Fi created vulnerabilities. Phishing surged by 220% during the early pandemic, and ransomware devastated critical infrastructure (e.g., Düsseldorf University Hospital, where a patient death was linked to downtime). International examples included Uganda’s disrupted mobile money networks. Organizations responded with antivirus licenses for employees, stronger Wi-Fi policies, and expanded awareness training.  
- **Critical Thinking in Cybersecurity** – Beyond technical skills, analysts must evaluate sources, avoid emotional reasoning, challenge assumptions, and consider multiple perspectives. Real-world applications include validating vulnerability reports before acting, engaging in evidence-based team discussions, and performing root cause analyses instead of relying on “quick fixes.”  
- **Critical Thinking Model** – Five elements: characteristics of thought (curiosity, skepticism, objectivity), technical skills (protocols, malware knowledge, tools), interpersonal skills (communication, teamwork, negotiation, project management), theoretical and experimental knowledge (principles + practice), and intellectual abilities (memory, reasoning, problem-solving).  
- **Critical Thinking Skills** – Five key abilities:  
  1. Challenging assumptions  
  2. Considering alternatives (who, what, when, where, why, how)  
  3. Evaluating data for reliability and bias  
  4. Identifying key drivers (motivations, vulnerabilities, impacts)  
  5. Understanding context (fitting incidents into larger threat landscapes)

## Module 2: Cybersecurity Threats  
This module categorizes threat actors, introduces malware and ransomware, and analyzes social engineering tactics.  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Identify major types of threat actors and their motives  
- Explain how malware, ransomware, and botnets operate  
- Recognize social engineering techniques and prevention methods  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Threat Actors:**  
  - Hacktivists (e.g., Anonymous) – motivated by political/social causes, often using defacement or DoS.  
  - Organized Crime (e.g., Lazarus Group) – financially motivated, responsible for Sony Pictures hack, WannaCry ransomware, and $300M cryptocurrency thefts.  
  - Nation-State Actors – government-sponsored espionage or sabotage; used extensively in conflicts like Russia–Ukraine.  
  - Script Kiddies – inexperienced attackers using pre-written tools (e.g., Mafiaboy’s 2000 DDoS attack on Yahoo and others).  
  - Insider Threats – disgruntled or negligent insiders (e.g., Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks).  
- **Malware & Botnets:**  
  - Malware types include viruses, worms, trojans, spyware, and adware.  
  - Botnets hijack devices (often targeting GPUs for crypto mining) and operate as hidden networks of compromised systems. Case study: botnet malware spread via spoofed professor emails with textbook PDFs.  
- **Ransomware:**  
  - Encrypts data (data loss) or threatens leaks (data breach).  
  - Defenses: frequent backups, strong access controls, encryption, patching, antivirus/EDR, and end-user training.  
- **Social Engineering:**  
  - Tactics include phishing, spear phishing, whaling, pretexting, vishing, baiting, and shoulder surfing.  
  - Case studies highlight credential theft via typo-squatted domains, exploitation of greed/fear, and use of personal information harvested from social media.

## Module 3: Cybersecurity Controls  
This module introduces common internet-based attacks and defensive measures.  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Describe internet attacks and their mechanisms  
- Apply controls to mitigate system and network risks  
- Explain vulnerability management and incident response  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Internet Attacks:** packet sniffing, IP spoofing, denial-of-service, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS).  
- **Defensive Controls:** firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), VPNs, encryption, and secure coding.  
- **Vulnerability Assessment & Patching:** scanning, prioritizing risks, zero-day defense.  
- **Incident Response & Forensics:** systematic investigation, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.

## Module 4: Identity and Physical Controls  
This module focuses on managing digital identities and defending physical infrastructure.  

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Implement IAM concepts with authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)  
- Compare authentication methods (SFA, 2FA, MFA)  
- Identify physical threats and appropriate countermeasures  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** enforcing least privilege, role-based access, and MFA to strengthen authentication.  
- **Physical Controls:** surveillance, locks, access cards, biometrics, environmental controls (fire suppression, power redundancy), and disaster recovery planning.

## Module 5: Final Project – Secure Access  
The final project consolidates knowledge through a scenario-based assignment. Learners evaluate organizational access policies, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend improvements across both IAM and physical safeguards.  

**Learning Objectives:**
