---

## Overview  
Course 12 serves as the capstone assessment and certification preparation module of the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate. It is designed to bridge academic learning with professional certification by preparing learners for two major industry credentials: **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** and **CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-003)**. The course covers exam eligibility, domains, testing strategies, and practical labs, while also providing timed, full-length mock exams to evaluate readiness. Learners build a personal study plan, practice hands-on labs, and explore how certifications impact career opportunities, salaries, and professional credibility.

## Module 1: CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Describe the structure, eligibility, and value of the Security+ exam  
- Identify and explain the five weighted domains  
- Develop a study plan aligned with exam content  
- Apply best practices for performance-based and multiple-choice questions  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Certification Value:** Security+ is ISO 17024 compliant and DoD 8570 approved, making it globally recognized. It is a baseline requirement for many SOC and IT security roles.  
- **Exam Format:** 90 minutes, maximum 90 questions (multiple choice + PBQs). Passing score = 750/900. Cost: $392 (as of 2025). Delivered at Pearson VUE centers or online proctoring.  
- **Domains & Weights:**  
  - Security Operations (28%)  
  - Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations (22%)  
  - Security Program Management & Oversight (20%)  
  - Security Architecture (18%)  
  - General Security Concepts (12%)  
- **Performance-Based Questions (PBQs):** Simulations covering firewall configuration, log analysis, packet tracing, vulnerability remediation, and secure design.  
- **Exam Preparation Strategies:**  
  - Read questions carefully, look for qualifiers like *best*, *first*, *most secure*.  
  - Apply elimination for distractors.  
  - Practice time management (~1 min per MCQ, ~3 min per PBQ).  
  - Take multiple practice exams to identify weak domains.  
- **Lab Environment Guidance:**  
  - Set up VMs with Windows, Linux, and a SIEM tool.  
  - Practice firewall and IDS/IPS configuration.  
  - Conduct vulnerability scans with tools like OpenVAS or Nessus.  
  - Capture/analyze packets using Wireshark.

## Module 2: CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-003)  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explain CySA+ eligibility, exam format, and career value  
- Identify and explain the four exam domains  
- Perform mock analysis tasks in a SOC environment  
- Apply study and testing strategies for CySA+  

**Key Topics & Details:**  
- **Certification Value:** CySA+ validates intermediate-level analyst skills in SOC operations, threat intelligence, and incident response. Required by some employers and DoD 8570 approved.  
- **Exam Format:** 165 minutes, maximum 85 questions (multiple choice + PBQs). Passing score = 750/900. Cost: $392 (as of 2025).  
- **Domains & Weights:**  
  - Threat & Vulnerability Management (22%)  
  - Software & Systems Security (18%)  
  - Security Operations & Monitoring (25%)  
  - Incident Response (25%)  
- **Example PBQs:**  
  - Analyze SIEM logs to detect lateral movement.  
  - Prioritize vulnerabilities in a scan report.  
  - Apply MITRE ATT&CK techniques to categorize adversary behavior.  
- **Preparation Techniques:**  
  - Build a SOC lab with a SIEM (e.g., Splunk, QRadar CE).  
  - Practice triaging phishing emails and correlating events.  
  - Review frameworks like NIST 800-61 and MITRE ATT&CK.  
- **Study Resources:** Official CompTIA CySA+ study guides, IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Certificate notes, practice exam banks, online forums, flashcards, and glossaries.

## Supplementary Resources  
- **IBM + CompTIA Partnership:** Discounts for Security+ and CySA+ vouchers and exam prep bundles.  
- **Study Planning Tools:** Personalized daily/weekly schedules, spaced repetition flashcards, domain-specific cheat sheets.  
- **Career Impact:**  
  - Security+ holders earn ~$9–13K more annually depending on experience levels.  
  - CySA+ holders qualify for Tier II SOC analyst roles, often bridging toward CASP+ or CISSP.  
- **Exam-Day Prep:**  
  - Sleep, hydration, light nutrition.  
  - Verify system compatibility for online proctoring.  
  - Prepare valid IDs and quiet workspace.  
  - Review PBQ strategy: don’t get stuck, flag and return.

## Hands-On Labs & Projects  
- **Security+ Practice Quizzes:** 20-question ungraded quizzes per domain.  
- **CySA+ Practice Quizzes:** 20-question ungraded quizzes per domain.  
- **Mock Exams:** Full-length, timed, graded exams simulating Pearson VUE format.  
- **Lab Setup Projects:** SOC environment build-out with SIEM, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanners, Wireshark, and cloud resources.  
- **Glossaries & Cheat Sheets:** Curated by domain with acronyms, commands, and use-case examples.  
- **Study Plan Development:** Personalized preparation roadmap integrating practice scores and lab work.
